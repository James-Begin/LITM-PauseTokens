Instead, it is about the attempt to discover the most general truths that we can find in the real world, not just abstract ideas.\n\nThis essay begins by examining the characteristics of the Yahoo acquisition announcement made by Y Combinator in June 1998, where CEO John Donahue made the announcement that Viaweb would become Yahoo!, but only after the founders gave him permission to name the company Viaweb. This unusual decision highlights the distinction between \"wisdom\" and \"intelligence,\" which are separate and distinct concepts.\n\nThe author defines wisdom as knowing what to do in a situation, whereas intelligence is a more general concept that includes various traits and abilities. However, the distinction between wisdom and intelligence is not necessarily about being smart or knowledgeable. According to the author, the best test of wisdom is that it involves doing something that you do not love, and most people would rather be doing anything else.\n\nThe author notes that even the most successful people have failed in their careers and had to reinvent themselves. They suggest that people who are good at something might be doing something wrong, as they often lack motivation and direction.\n\nThe author defines a perfect test of wisdom as doing what you think you would do, regardless of what others think of it. This requires a certain level of humility and self-awareness. The author argues that being a \"super angel\" or a \"super VC\" does not mean that someone is necessarily better or more successful than others.\n\nThe author also notes that people are often misled by superficial reasons, such as popularity, prestige, or profit, rather than genuine understanding of the topic. They suggest that the way to achieve true wisdom is to take a leap of faith and try new things, even if it means risking the risk of failure.\n\nThe author highlights the importance of humility and the avoidance of defaulting to prestige or popularity when making decisions. This is particularly relevant in the context of startup work, where people are often hesitant to take risks and experiment with new ideas.\n\nThe author also notes that the concept of \"good taste\" is often misunderstood, as it is often tied to what is currently popular. However, good taste is a deeper and more universal concept that is not necessarily tied to aesthetics or taste in art.\n\nThe author's goal is to show that the path to true wisdom is not about identifying great works of art, but rather about finding things that excite and challenge oneself.\n\nFinally,"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.31538152694702, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:27:17+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_7400"}
