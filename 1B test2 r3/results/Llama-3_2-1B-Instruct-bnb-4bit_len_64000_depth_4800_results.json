This essay touches on the themes of wisdom, intelligence, and the relationship between them, as well as the challenges of navigating startup culture and finding meaningful work in tech.\n\nThe authors argue that while most startups prioritize valuations and valuations alone, super-angels and VCs prioritize high valuation as the primary metric for success. This shift in focus from valuation to valuation means that startups can reap the benefits of valuations, but the valuations are still set by the VCs, not the startups.\n\nThe essay introduces the concept of the \"wisdom test,\" which involves asking someone to imagine themselves in the shoes of a domain expert and thinking like them. This approach can help identify areas of strength and weaknesses in a field or startup. It also encourages readers to think creatively and critically, rather than simply memorizing and following the \"what they knew best.\"\n\nThe authors acknowledge that many people have difficulty distinguishing between new ideas and old ones, and that the best approach is to identify a good idea and do it. This is particularly true for domain experts, who may have a specific area of knowledge that they excel in. The essay also touches on the idea that expertise is not necessarily equivalent to being \"smart\" or \"talented.\"\n\nOne of the authors' key points is that most people are reluctant to acknowledge bias, including when it comes to new ideas. They propose the technique of \"paradigm shifting,\" where readers consider whether an idea is supported or challenged by those around them. This involves being open to considering multiple perspectives and challenging one's own biases.\n\nThe essay touches on various aspects of business and startup culture, including the need for individuals to be true to their passions and avoid taking \"cog\" jobs. The authors highlight the importance of self-discovery and experimentation, and that it's essential to define and set clear goals to achieve success. They also emphasize the need for individuals to avoid shortcuts and take calculated risks, as many startups fail and fail miserably.\n\nThe final section of the essay explores the concept of \"organic growth\" versus \"organic business development,\" where individuals take risks to create their own path rather than following a set script. It also touches on the idea that it's not always easy to stay focused and maintain one's passion for an idea, and that individuals must be willing to be adaptable and adjust their goals as circumstances change"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.184330463409424, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:25:40+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
