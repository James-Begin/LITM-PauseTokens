The author suggests that both are intertwined but not necessarily equal, with a distinction between them.\n\nThe author argues that the key to achieving wisdom is to cultivate self-discipline and a curious mindset, which involves identifying the right problem to tackle and working on it relentlessly. However, this process can be hindered by the desire for immediate results, leading to the \"gambling with the system.\"\n\nOn the other hand, intelligence refers to the ability to solve complex problems, but it can also lead to being a perfectionist or a control freak, which can actually hinder a startup's growth.\n\nThe author also highlights the importance of humility and adaptability in achieving wisdom and intelligence. In many fields, including sports and music, people who are naturally good at their craft tend to be better at understanding and learning new things, even if they don't always understand the best solution.\n\nUltimately, the author believes that achieving wisdom and intelligence in a startup requires careful consideration of one's character and the ability to take calculated risks, rather than relying solely on intelligence or wisdom.\n\nIt's essential to remember that a startup's success often relies on many factors beyond just the individual's intelligence or wisdom, such as team dynamics, environment, and external factors like marketing and competition.\n\nA good solution for entrepreneurs might be to adopt a more humble and adaptable approach, focusing on building a strong team, learning from failure, and adapting to changing circumstances.\n\nBy being aware of the distinction between wisdom and intelligence and prioritizing adaptability and team effort, entrepreneurs can create a strong foundation for success, even if they don't possess all of either."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 13.261539936065674, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:19:47+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_1600"}
