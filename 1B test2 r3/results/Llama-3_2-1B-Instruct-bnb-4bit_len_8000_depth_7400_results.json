Aristotle proposed that philosophy should focus on discovering the most general truths, not just useful or interesting ideas.\n2.  He started his work with logic and zoology, which later developed into modern philosophy, but his focus was on the most general truths.\n3.  Aristotle's unique contribution was the development of a new, more analytical style of thinking.\n4.  His ideas were influential, but not as influential as many previously thought.\n5.  Philosophy's meaning has changed over time, and ancient philosophers' works covered a broad range of topics, but the core of philosophy was to discover the most general truths.\n6.  European culture's influence on philosophy is evident, with Aristotle's ideas being widely influential, but often with the wrong application.\n\nBest answer: Discover the most general truths.\n\nIn essence, this phrase is the best answer because it implies starting with useful or interesting ideas, but ultimately aiming to discover the fundamental truths that underlie all phenomena."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 7.533665418624878, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:17:07+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_7400"}
