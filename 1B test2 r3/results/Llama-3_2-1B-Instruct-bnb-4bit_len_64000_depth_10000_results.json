While wisdom is about knowing what to do, being good at it, and being happy, intelligence is more about knowing and mastering what you do.\n\n**Do what you love**\n\nThe author suggests that it's possible to do something you love, but it's not necessary for success. The concept of \"do what you love\" is not unique to business, as it is also applicable to art, writing, and other creative endeavors.\n\n**The two-job and organic routes to success**\n\nThe author proposes two approaches to achieving success: the two-job route and the organic route. The two-job route involves working at two jobs, but in a way that you're not necessarily passionate about them. The organic route involves working on various projects and building a portfolio to increase your chances of finding a job that aligns with your interests.\n\n**Easier to get hired for a startup over a traditional job**\n\nThe author notes that hiring for startups is often a matter of supply and demand, rather than supply and demand. Most people get hired for startups because they're looking for a job that pays well, not necessarily because they have a specific skill set.\n\n**The importance of knowing what you want**\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of understanding what you want to do, even if it's just a hobby or interest. Having a list of potential projects can help you focus on the things you're passionate about, which can lead to a fulfilling career.\n\n**Understanding and explaining the value of art**\n\nThe author discusses the concept of \"good taste\" and how it's not always a fixed concept. While art has a significant value in understanding how to create it, it's not always based on objective criteria, but rather on how people interact with art.\n\n**The importance of being adaptable**\n\nThe author notes that being adaptable is crucial for success in the startup world, but it's also important to be authentic and true to yourself. If you want to be successful in art, you must first understand what that art is about.\n\n**The importance of community**\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of community and collaboration in achieving success. If you're working on a project, it's essential to surround yourself with people who share your interests and passions"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 22.452165126800537, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:30:06+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_10000"}
