This is my first response in a series of responses to questions. I will provide a detailed, step-by-step answer to each question.\n\nTo answer your first question:\n\nIt's 1995. A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998, the founders of Viaweb (later renamed Yahoo! in 1994) took a snapshot of their site. A snippet of their site was available online, which they thought would be useful to other companies. They decided to write software that could connect to their site, allowing users to build online stores. This was a novel idea that would later become a big part of the online shopping experience.\n\nTo answer your second question:\n\nThe early 1990s were a challenging time for startups. Many founders were young and ambitious, but most startups had no experience in business. A key problem was the lack of access to venture capital, as VCs were interested in investing in established companies, not startups. A solution to this problem was to use angel funding, where VCs invested small amounts of money and took a risk on new startups. Y Combinator was formed in 2001, initially as a source of capital for startups.\n\nTo answer your third question:\n\nThe founders of Viaweb were primarily self-taught, as they did not have access to formal education or training in computer science. To help them design a language, they began by writing simple programs in languages like Fortran and C. Later, they created a language called Lisp, which was designed for writing more complex applications.\n\nTo answer your fourth question:\n\nThe first part of the software was called editor, which was used to build static sites. The second part of the software was called shopping cart, which was used to generate dynamic sites. A manager was added to track orders and statistics.\n\nTo answer your fifth question:\n\nThe first version of the system builder was written in Unix, and it was not easy to write software on these systems. The founders used Lisp, a language that was originally created for mathematical calculations.\n\nTo answer your sixth question:\n\nOne of the most profitable startups, Yahoo! did not need a big marketing budget, as they already had a lot of existing traffic. They started running ads for their new online store, which was called the \"store builder\".\n\nTo answer your seventh question:\n\nThe founders had to spend a lot of time and effort on their marketing efforts to get the word out about their new service.\n\n"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 45.21867227554321, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:45:31+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_10000"}
