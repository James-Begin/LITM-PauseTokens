The author, who started his startup Viaweb in 1995, shares his experiences and the insights gained from the journey.\n\nHe explains that the distinction between wisdom and intelligence is not clearly defined and has varied throughout history. He cites examples from philosophy, history, and the study of math to support this concept.\n\nThe author also emphasizes the importance of understanding that people with a deep understanding of a subject often have an unconscious curiosity about it, and vice versa. He highlights the importance of recognizing one's biases and trying not to be like other people who often judge what they don't know.\n\nHe then discusses the concept of \"paradigms\" and how it affects our thinking, particularly in the context of economics and the business world. He explains that money and prestige are often prioritized over talent and hard work, leading to people choosing jobs that are not fulfilling and often lead to failure.\n\nThe author shares an essay about the author's own journey, which discusses the importance of finding what you like to do and learning from it. He warns about the dangers of the \"organic route\" of seeking work that one likes and the \"two-job route\" of trying to combine different jobs and work on multiple things without standing the risk.\n\nHe shares another essay that discusses the importance of creating a backup plan for the future and identifying the things that you want to do, and provides a list of commands to help you do so. He encourages people to be mindful of their thoughts and to create a list of things they want to do, and to use self-awareness to help them avoid mistakes.\n\nThe author also shares a story about a friend's struggles with fame and the importance of having a clear path and avoiding the trap of making decisions based on superficial appearances."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 16.90135645866394, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:28:00+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_8700"}
