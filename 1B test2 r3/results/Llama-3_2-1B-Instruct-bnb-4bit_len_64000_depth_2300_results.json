However, they now understand that it's not a single, innate trait, but rather a skill that can be developed and cultivated. They also express their frustration with the concept of \"wisdom\" and how it's often used interchangeably with \"intelligence.\" \n\nThe author believes that most people misunderstand the difference between wisdom and intelligence, and that there's a spectrum of intelligence, with most people being mediocre in most aspects. They also explore the idea that \"wisdom\" is a characteristic that is acquired, not innate, and that it can be cultivated through experience and effort.\n\nThe author presents 16 essays, including a discussion on the importance of humility and not letting ego get in the way of learning. They also highlight the role of expertise in programming languages like Lisp, which is a powerful tool for creative problem-solving. \n\nThe author reflects on the challenges of balancing personal needs with the demands of entrepreneurship, as well as the pressure to conform to societal expectations and the impact of social norms on one's work. They argue that the pursuit of knowledge and innovation is often driven by curiosity, rather than a desire for financial gain.\n\nThe author provides a counterexample by citing a philosopher, Aristotle, who is often misunderstood as being obtuse or arrogant, when in fact he was a wise man who understood the value of creativity and exploration. They also discuss the importance of having a personal mission or purpose in one's work, rather than simply trying to maximize profits or gain prestige.\n\nThe author's writings challenge the conventional wisdom that most people are bad at what they do, and that only those who are successful in their careers should be able to claim expertise in areas they're unfamiliar with. Instead, they argue that there are individuals who may be excellent at certain tasks, but lack expertise in others.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the importance of thinking outside the box, exploring new ideas, and cultivating one's passions, rather than following the normative expectations of the world. They encourage readers to adopt a more holistic and flexible approach to learning and self-improvement, and to prioritize creativity"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.227795839309692, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:24:05+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_2300"}
