The author argues that the field of philosophy is more likely to be useful and influential than it seems, and that most philosophers have wasted their time by focusing on abstract and imprecise concepts.\n\nThe author suggests that the current state of philosophy is characterized by a \"singularity\" \u2013 a field that is too broad and vague, with little practical application. The author argues that philosophy should aim for \"utility\" (not just \"usefulness\") and that new ideas should be \"general plus useful\" rather than just abstract or imprecise.\n\nThe author points to various historical examples, such as the development of mathematics and science, as evidence that these fields have made significant contributions despite being imprecise or abstract. The author also draws on quotes from Wittgenstein and Russell to emphasize the importance of precision and clarity in intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe author suggests that philosophers can be more productive by focusing on \"applicability\" (the idea that knowledge has practical uses) rather than just abstract or useless ideas. The author quotes Sokal's work on the rejection of certain philosophical texts and argues that people in the humanities often rely on vague or imprecise language to make assertions.\n\nFinally, the author notes that while philosophy may seem to be a waste of time, many philosophers have indeed wasted their time, and that there is still much to be discovered in the field, particularly in the \"imprecise half\" of philosophy, where new ideas and concepts are being developed."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 12.070881128311157, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:14:17+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_5500"}
