He mentions the \"worry\" of being overworked and worrying about prestige and fame, as people often put the needs of others before one's own. He also shares examples of how he overthrew traditional thinking and values, particularly regarding how people view success and prestige.\n\nThe author notes that the idea of work being bad is not as old as it seems, as people often pretend to be happy to work on tasks that they find boring. He also notes that the \"secret weapon\" of his startup was using a Lisp programming language, which allowed him to write applications quickly and efficiently, especially when compared to other programming languages like C and Java.\n\nThe author shares examples of his mistakes, such as overworking friends and colleagues, and how he used to be a philosophy major who never actually took classes in philosophy.\n\nHe notes that the concept of \"good taste\" is often misunderstood, and that it's actually about understanding and engaging with a particular work of art, not just evaluating it.\n\nThe author shares his views on what it means to have a \"good taste\" and how to cultivate it. He believes that it's a combination of skills, knowledge, and experience that can be developed, and that it's not as hard as people think.\n\nThe author also discusses the \"two-job route\" and the \"organic route\" to success, where one focuses on developing skills and avoiding monotony, and another where one focuses on doing one thing and doing it well.\n\nFinally, the author discusses the importance of self-awareness, discipline, and hard work in achieving success, and shares his own experience of feeling a sense of emptiness and doubt, as well as his desire to explore and learn from the world."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 19.255879163742065, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:29:06+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_9300"}
