The author, now a successful entrepreneur, reflects on his early experiences and the evolution of the tech industry, including the impact of the early days of the internet and the emergence of startups as a phenomenon.\n\nThe author shares his childhood experiences of feeling like an outsider, being made to work on difficult tasks and not receiving the recognition he felt he deserved. He explains that he would often spend hours writing code, and in the early days of the internet, it seemed that most companies were only interested in marketing their products, not providing value to their users.\n\nThe author introduces the concept of \"implied value,\" which refers to the expected utility or usefulness of a product or service. He argues that companies often focus more on marketing their products than providing value to their users, which leads to an environment where \"low valuation\" is common.\n\nHe also discusses the \" fatal pinch,\" where a startup's valuation becomes its own best friend, and \"slow growth\" or \"unsuitable partnerships\" can lead to financial struggles. The author suggests that understanding the concept of \"bad money\" \u2013 the concept of investing in startups and watching them fail \u2013 can help entrepreneurs make better decisions.\n\nThe author shares various anecdotes, including the story of the first computer programmer and how he spent 8-9 years studying philosophy before turning to coding, and the story of a friend who tried to get a job at a high-end restaurant.\n\nHe also explains the concept of \"impossible to work without thinking about it,\" and how this concept is not unique to the startup world. The author notes that this concept is not necessarily true and will always be a factor, and that some people may be more likely to make mistakes by default.\n\nThroughout the essay, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the motivations and intentions behind the decisions made by others, and to keep the intention to do what you want. He suggests that an entrepreneur should aim to discover \"what to do\" rather than \"what you want to do,\" as this is often a mistake.\n\nThe author concludes the essay by emphasizing the importance of humility, creativity, and resilience, and suggesting that an entrepreneur should be willing to try new things, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. He also highlights the need to create an environment that allows for experimentation and learning.\n\nThe essay concludes by acknowledging that the author"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.259771585464478, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:25:16+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4200"}
