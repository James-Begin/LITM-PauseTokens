This is a trap that startups often fall into. Y Combinator, a well-known startup funding platform, recently lost a deal with Uber because they felt that the valuation they asked for was too high.\n\nStartups have a tendency to overanalyze and over-engineer problems, which can lead to high valuations. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that most startups are focused on early-stage problems, where they have a high burn rate and need rapid iteration. However, the current valuation landscape is becoming increasingly tiered, with only the most successful startups receiving high valuations. As a result, startups are being incentivized to focus on finding the right valuation, which can lead to higher valuations than they would have otherwise.\n\nIn contrast, some successful startups use a \"two-job\" approach, where they focus on building multiple products or services simultaneously. While this approach has its risks, it can also provide a sense of security and allow them to build more reliable products. This approach is not recommended for all startups, but it is a viable option for those who are unsure about the direction of their product or market.\n\nAs for the best thing to do in San Francisco, the best approach is not to worry about prestige or fame. Most startups are not interested in publishing their work; they are focused on building a product that solves a real problem.\n\nTo optimize the outcome of any situation, one should consider multiple factors, including the people who are best at the task, the risk of failure, and the benefits of each option. For startups, this means being willing to take calculated risks and explore different paths. It's also essential to focus on producing high-quality work, rather than trying to appeal to an audience with a strong following.\n\nUltimately, the key to success in startups is to focus on building a robust pipeline of potential customers, rather than just relying on word-of-mouth. This means being willing to take risks and explore new opportunities, even if they might not be successful at first.\n\nIn conclusion, the startup ecosystem in San Francisco is not as welcoming as it used to be, with more emphasis on marketing and prestige than innovation and solving real problems. This has led to a situation where investors are more interested in attracting attention than providing value to their investments.
