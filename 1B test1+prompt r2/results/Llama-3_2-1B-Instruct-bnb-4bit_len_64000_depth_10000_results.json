Writing in notebooks instead of with words is a good idea. If you want to write novels, a day job, a career that you're passionate about and in which you can take risks, you're more likely to succeed. Writing in a different language, like Lisp, can be good even if it's hard, which it often is. A good friend's advice is to try new things and not worry about what others think. If you think of working on a project before you start, you may want to know what you want to do before you start. \n\nStart with a specific goal, like writing for 10 minutes in silence. Try to do something you love so much that it takes your mind off boring topics. If you can imagine yourself doing something like that, you'll know you're doing something worthwhile. Take time to read books, not just books that are easily digestible, and explore different fields. If you want to become a hacker, that's okay; you might even be a better hacker because you're exploring new ideas.\n\nA friend of mine told me that writing about their own work is a way of imitating others. So they'd spend hours writing in English classes without realizing it. To write about what you love, start with a list of things you love to do. This will help you decide what you want to do, even if you don't like them."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 14.199713706970215, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:01:20+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_10000"}
