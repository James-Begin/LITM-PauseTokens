When it comes to programming languages, being a startup is about having a great language that's easy to use, provides the features you want, and isn't too much trouble to understand.\n\nThe best startups are those that start with a specific goal in mind and work from there. They focus on the user's needs, whether they're users, customers, or employees. They also have a strong design team behind them, which means they invest a lot in researching and developing the language.\n\nWhen it comes to designing programming languages, you need to consider the target audience, the purpose of the language, and the level of sophistication needed. A good language should be both clean and dirty, with a small core of well-understood and highly orthogonal operators, but not too dense or complex.\n\nBrevity is also crucial, as it requires a high level of coding to achieve. Libraries are essential to provide the tools and functionality that users need, while keeping it as simple and easy to learn as possible.\n\nThe key to creating a great language is to keep two opposing ideas in mind. You need the young hacker's naive faith in their abilities, while also being skeptical and realistic. You need the veteran's skepticism, not just of the language itself, but of the people who use it.\n\nDesigning a language is a two-cycle innovation engine, where you work on a problem, then think about it from the perspective of solving it. You have to keep hope and worry balanced, and this is true for all innovations, including the design of the language itself.\n\nThe best language design is to be rewritten, and it's not just about writing a lot of code. You need to understand your target audience, the problem you're trying to solve, and how hard you can be pushed to make it work.\n\nUltimately, the key to creating a great language is to have a good profiler, where you can track the performance of your code in a straightforward manner. This means keeping the design to have a good balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nThe best way to optimize code is to focus on making it readable and efficient, rather than trying to write extremely complex or efficient code. You need to keep learning, which is where creativity and problem-solving come into play.\n\nIn the end, being optimistic and skeptical about two different things is key to creating a great language.
