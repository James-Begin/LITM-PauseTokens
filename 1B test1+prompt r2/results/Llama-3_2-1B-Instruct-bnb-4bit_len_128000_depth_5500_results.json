The author's name is not given in the text. Here's a summary of the main points:\n\n1. **Viaweb**: The author co-founded Viaweb in the early 1990s with Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell. They were interested in creating software that would run on the web, not the desktop.\n2. **Lisp**: The author wanted to design a programming language that would be easy to use and would be widely adopted. He started using Lisp to write a web-based application, which was eventually turned into a commercial product called Yaw, Inc.\n3. **Designing for the user**: The author emphasizes the importance of designing for the user, not just the programmer. He believes that a good language should be intuitive and easy to use, even if the language itself is complex.\n4. **Language vs. programming language**: The author distinguishes between language design and programming language design. Programming languages are not inherently good or bad; they're tools that must be designed to be useful to the user.\n5. **Brevity**: A good language should have short code that's easy to read and maintain. The author believes that brevity is essential in programming.\n6. **External factors**: The author notes that the popularity of a language depends on external factors, such as marketing and user base, rather than solely on the language itself.\n7. **Brevity and libraries**: The author highlights the importance of brevity and libraries in programming. Libraries should be designed to support the language, not the other way around.\n8. **Time**: The author emphasizes the importance of designating time and effort in programming. A good language should be designed to get it done quickly and efficiently.\n9. **Efficiency**: A good language should be efficient in terms of time and resources. The author suggests that a language should aim to have minimal overhead.\n10. **Error analysis**: The author notes that error analysis is crucial in programming. A good language should be able to identify errors and correct them.\n11. **Effort cycle**: The author describes the effort cycle as a key factor in designing a language. A good language should have a well-organized effort cycle that encourages and rewards the creator.\n12. **Simplicity**: The author believes that simplicity is key to creating a good language.
