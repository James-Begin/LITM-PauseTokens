The author argues that true wisdom involves knowing what to do, not just knowing it, and being able to enjoy the work, rather than just being able to recognize that it is enjoyable.\n\nThe essay highlights the paradoxical nature of \"wisdom\" and \"intelligence,\" where true wisdom seems to involve knowing what to do, but not necessarily knowing what to think about. The author challenges the conventional wisdom that everyone thinks there is no such thing as \"good taste\" or \"art,\" and that most people's preferences are based on shallow, superficial reasons.\n\nThe author argues that a true sense of taste involves understanding the subject matter, not just recognizing it, and that people tend to default to prestige and money in their judgments of art and work. However, most people fail to appreciate good taste and art, and instead choose the familiar or well-trodden paths.\n\nThe author suggests that most people's preferences are guided by superficial factors such as fame, authorship, or material possessions, rather than a deeper understanding of the subject matter. They argue that true wisdom involves understanding the subject matter and being able to enjoy the work, rather than just recognizing it.\n\nThe essay also explores the concept of \"appreciation\" and how it can be misused, citing examples of people pretending to appreciate art without actually enjoying it. The author proposes a new approach to appreciation, where people should focus on genuinely appreciating the work for its inherent value, rather than just its surface-level qualities.\n\nThe final section of the essay discusses the concept of \"prestige\" and how it can lead people to pretend to like something that they do not actually enjoy. The author suggests that true appreciation and true wisdom involve being self-aware and honest, and that we should strive to be truthful about our preferences.\n\nThe essay concludes by highlighting the importance of exploring and understanding one's own preferences and tastes, and encouraging readers to approach creative work with an open mind and a willingness to take risks and try new things."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.42856216430664, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:59:50+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_7400"}
