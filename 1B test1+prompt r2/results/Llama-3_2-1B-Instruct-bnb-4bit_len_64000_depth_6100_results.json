The author, a co-founder of Viaweb, shares their own experiences and insights on what makes a startup successful. The essay starts with the idea of the power of the \"organic\" route, where you focus on finding work you love, rather than just taking any job for the sake of making money.\n\nThe author notes that most people fail in startups because they lack direction and discipline. They point to examples of famous figures, such as the artist Leonardo da Vinci and the mathematician Euclid, who were not only accomplished in their field but also had a strong sense of purpose and discipline.\n\nThe author argues that the key to success is not knowing what to want, but having a list of things that are essential to your work. The \"5 regrets\" that students typically write in essays is often about getting overwhelmed by the responsibilities of adulthood, working too much, ignoring important relationships, and neglecting one's health. The author suggests a new approach to writing, where you try to identify your goals and write about things you're passionate about.\n\nThe author provides an example of how the \"2-job\" route works, where you take a job and work on something you love, but with less risk of it failing. The author argues that this route is better than the \"organic\" route, where you focus on finding what you want to do, as it's easier to get lost in your passion.\n\nThe author also emphasizes the importance of having a solid foundation in the \"2-job\" route. The \"5 regrets\" are often about struggling to balance work and other responsibilities, and the author suggests that you should try to prioritize your work and put in a certain amount of time to focus on it, or rather, try to find something you love to do.\n\nThe author encourages readers to think about their life and figure out what they want to do, not just what they are good at. They argue that it's easier to get lost in your work if you're passionate about it, but not necessarily if you're successful. The author suggests that a good essay is not about expressing a particular thought or message, but rather about showing a genuine interest in the subject matter.\n\nThe author also emphasizes the importance of having a writing routine, where you write regularly and consistently, and not just for the sake of creating something. They argue that it's hard to do great writing, and"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.156044244766235, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:59:09+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_6100"}
