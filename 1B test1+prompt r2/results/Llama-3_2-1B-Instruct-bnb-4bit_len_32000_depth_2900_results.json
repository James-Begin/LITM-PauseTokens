In fact, hiring too fast can lead to the \"fatal pinch,\" where the startup struggles financially and is in a difficult position.\n\nTo avoid the fatal pinch, founders should ask themselves early whether they are default alive (i.e., viable and viable revenue) or default dead (i.e., struggling to stay afloat). If they are default dead, they should have a plan B, as in case plan A isn't working. They should also separate the facts from the hopes and have a realistic understanding of their financial situation.\n\nInstead of relying on investors, founders should have a plan B as well, which includes a plan C as a backup plan. They should count on investing in order to avoid the fatal pinch, rather than relying on fundraising to save the startup.\n\nTo calculate profitability, founders should keep track of their expenses and revenue, and estimate how long it will take for their business to be profitable. This will help them determine whether they are default dead or default alive."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.42636775970459, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:53:38+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_2900"}
