The author's first experience with Viaweb, a startup founded by Robert Morris and Larry Page, was a key experience in shaping their views on wisdom and intelligence.\n\nThe author reflects on how the founders' experiences and struggles with Viaweb's early success challenged their conventional wisdom about what constitutes \"good\" work and what makes people successful. They describe their experiences with various forms of writing, including poetry, philosophy, and business, as a way to understand their love of work and how it relates to their passion for knowledge. \n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of curiosity and self-exploration in achieving wisdom, and how one can distinguish between doing things that might be considered creative but not wise, and doing things that bring a sense of satisfaction. They also explore the concept of \"prestige\" and how it can be misleading, as it often refers to the status of a position or achievement rather than a genuine desire or passion.\n\nThe author argues that the pursuit of knowledge is not limited to the academic world but is also present in non-academic domains, and that true wisdom involves understanding that a good outcome is not necessarily a good result. The author provides examples of how people's ideas and values can be flawed, and how they often overlook the nuances of the situation. They emphasize the importance of recognizing one's own biases and limitations, and of being open to learning from others.\n\nThe author notes that the concept of \"paradigm\" has been misunderstood, as it refers to a fixed set of ideas or beliefs that people hold onto, rather than recognizing the fluidity of knowledge and its relationship to the world. They argue that true wisdom involves recognizing the nuances of the situation and being open to learning and adaptation.\n\nThe author also touches on the concept of \"thinking outside the paradigm,\" as described by Thomas Kuhn, and how it is often easier to challenge established norms than to do so.\n\nThe essay concludes by asking questions about what is the best thing to do in San Francisco, highlighting the tension between following conventional wisdom and doing one's own thing."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 19.03702402114868, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:56:44+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1600"}
