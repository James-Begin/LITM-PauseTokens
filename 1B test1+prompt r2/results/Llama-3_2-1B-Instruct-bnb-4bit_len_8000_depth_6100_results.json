This means considering whether one's writing will cause people to do something differently after reading it. The essay argues that this approach can help philosophers to approach abstraction in a useful and general way, as seen in the case of Darwin's theory of evolution, which has broad applications in various fields such as genetics and product design."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 4.5478057861328125, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:50:50+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_6100"}
