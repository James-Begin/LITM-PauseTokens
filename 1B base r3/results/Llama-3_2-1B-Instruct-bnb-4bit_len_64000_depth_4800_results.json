To start a startup, you need to know some things about programming and the software landscape, and a good mindset and a decent amount of effort, particularly in terms of learning, experimenting, and debugging.\n\nIt's not about having expertise in the field, but rather about having a good understanding of your users and the problem you're solving for them. One potential approach is to use a throwaway program to test your idea out before you can refine it further. By doing so, you can ensure that your initial idea is functional and meets certain standards.\n\nWhen it comes to language, it's not just about writing something that's as good as possible, but also about understanding the underlying concepts and how they work. In the case of Lisp, a programming language that's extremely powerful and flexible, a good idea is one that can be implemented quickly and with minimal overhead.\n\nA good language should be able to handle the most powerful problems effectively, with little overhead. Having a good profiler can also be helpful, but it's not the only thing that's important, as it can be easily turned off or ignored.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create a language that's good for writing the kinds of programs that hackers want to write, with a focus on brevity, not just syntax. A good language should have powerful libraries that make it easy to write a lot of code with a small number of lines of code.\n\nA key characteristic of good hackers is that they're able to break into systems with ease and do whatever is necessary to get it done, without being restricted by external constraints. A good language should allow for flexible, adaptable code, with good libraries that can handle a wide range of tasks.\n\nWhen starting out, it's easy to make mistakes and lose motivation. But with persistence and the right mindset, you can learn quickly, as you've done in this case. The key is to keep a mix of optimism and skepticism when faced with problems, to be able to think creatively and solve them.\n\nIn a startup, you can't let fear of taking risks and failure dictate your decision-making. It's better to ask questions and not know the outcome. This is particularly true for those who want to start a startup.
