To do this, you need to understand what your users want, who they are, and what they need from you. This can be achieved through careful user research and understanding their pain points.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes founders make is ignoring the people who will be using your product, rather than trying to attract them. This can lead to a focus on the wrong things, like features and functionality, rather than the people. To counter this, focus on building a social component of your product, and try to understand what makes people tick.\n\nAnother mistake is to try to work alone, relying on yourself to solve the problems of your startup. While this can be good for you, it's not good for the users. To get more value from your users, you need to think about their needs, not your own.\n\nThe founders of the startup, Viaweb, had a similar approach. They designed a language called Lisp, which was then applied to online store builders. The language was designed to be easy to use and to provide a value proposition to the users. The founders did this because they were passionate about the idea, not because they were looking for quick returns.\n\nThe founders also realized that the target audience would be self-motivated and had high standards. They understood that users wanted to create something that looked good, not just made it work. They realized that users would take a long time to create something good, so they had to have a good understanding of their target audience.\n\nIn the end, Viaweb's strategy paid off. The founders were able to raise money quickly, which helped them grow the business. However, they also learned that they had to prioritize their users and focus on creating value, rather than trying to attract a large number of users.\n\nThe best way to do this is to have a clear understanding of what your target audience is, and to create a social component of your product. This will help you build a loyal user base and create value for them. It's not about creating a product that's just good; it's about creating something that makes a difference.\n\nThe founders of Viaweb also realized that they would never get enough data to predict what would work in the market. They started to think about other areas of their business, like education and product development.
