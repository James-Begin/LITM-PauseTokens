The author argues that traditional startup financing models, such as Y Combinator (YCombinator), are becoming obsolete.\n\nThe author notes that the super-angels (high-profile investors who fund startups) have become increasingly aggressive in their expectations and are willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want. They offer only a fraction of the money they could, and are willing to invest in startups with minimal due diligence. This can be seen as a major obstacle for many startups, which are forced to raise money from these investors even when they have no clear idea of who they are, what their product offers, or how it will succeed.\n\nThe author suggests that this shift has had disastrous consequences for startups. They have led to a situation where startups are not valued based on their market potential, but rather on the money they can secure. As a result, the best and most promising startups are not being funded, and many are failing.\n\nThe author suggests that traditional startup financing models, such as YCombinator, are no longer an option for startups. They propose that the new startup financing model, which involves partnering with established companies like YCombinator, should be the new standard.\n\nTo write a successful startup, the author argues, you need to have a great idea, a passionate team, and the right mindset. You need to be able to write a good code, have good libraries, and be able to iterate quickly.\n\nThe author notes that the key to success is to have a \"dream language,\" a language that makes it easy to write the most general concepts first, before moving on to specifics. They argue that this means being able to write programs to solve common problems without having to use complex syntax or coding.\n\nThe author also suggests that a successful startup needs a good team, good libraries, and a good business model. It should be a hybrid of a programming language and a business model, and should be designed to appeal to a wide range of users, rather than just a select few.\n\nThe author notes that the government could help the startup ecosystem by establishing a new class of visas for startup founders to enter the country. This would create a pipeline of new founders and increase the number of startups that could be founded each year.\n\nFinally, the author argues that the government could also implement policies to make it easier for startups to grow and succeed"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.362399339675903, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:08:09+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1000"}
