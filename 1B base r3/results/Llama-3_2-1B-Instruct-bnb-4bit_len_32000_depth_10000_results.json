To get funded by Y Combinator. Here's a starting point:\n\nStart by framing the question wrong, as Robert Morris suggested. Instead of focusing on making a product that \"gets rid of the middleman,\" think about creating a system that simplifies the process, allowing people to create online stores without being limited by language and technology.\n\nFocus on chance meetings and networking, rather than trying to predict and anticipate their needs. This will help you identify and tap into the right ecosystem.\n\nLook for environments that encourage innovation and collaboration, such as Silicon Valley, where the density of people is high and the culture of sharing knowledge is strong.\n\nBe prepared to adapt and innovate quickly, as the field is rapidly changing and new opportunities are emerging.\n\nEmphasize the benefits of working together and building relationships with others, rather than trying to compete with them. Focus on creating something that is useful and valuable to others, not just for yourself.\n\nBe willing to take risks and challenge conventional wisdom. Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and seek out new ideas and perspectives.\n\nBy focusing on these principles, you can create a startup that is successful, even if you don't fit the conventional mold."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.78054165840149, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:07:45+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_10000"}
