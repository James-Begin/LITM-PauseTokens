But we were also dumb enough to know nothing.  I think the most important thing is to be able to figure out the thing that makes it work.  The first startup we started was Viaweb, which we decided to start in September of 1995.  To be honest, we didn't know what to do.  We'd just thought we wanted to create software that would help users build online stores.  So we just did it.  We didn't know if it was a good idea or not, but we were smart enough to figure it out.\n\n\"We were smart enough to know that we were not stupid.  In fact, we were quite smart about not being stupid.  We knew what made people stupid, and we knew how to avoid it.  That's the key to success in startups.  If you're smart about the problem, not about the solution, you'll be okay.  And if you're stupid about the solution, you'll probably end up with no clients.  So we were smart enough to not be stupid.  But we were also smart enough to know how to raise money.  That's the key to success in startups.\n\n\"Starting a business is not just about getting rich quick.  It's about being able to raise money.  The more people who can give you money, the easier it is to succeed.  If you can impress people with your intelligence, you'll have a chance to raise money.  But if you can impress people with your creativity, you'll have a chance to raise money.  So don't worry too much about whether you can raise money.  Focus on making the best product.  That's the key to success.\n\n\"The first thing you should do is to find a problem that's just not solved.  Not just a problem that's hard to solve.  A problem that's just not popular, or not just not good.  A problem that's just not there yet.  And then focus on solving that problem.  Don't try to solve something that doesn't exist.  Don't try to solve something that's not being built.  Focus on solving the thing that you know"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 43.90185284614563, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:14:26+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_2300"}
