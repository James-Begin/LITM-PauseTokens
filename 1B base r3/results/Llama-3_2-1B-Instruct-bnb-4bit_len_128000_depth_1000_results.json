This involves a combination of two key components. First, the initial idea and concept must be strong, so don't start with the plan. Second, the platform should be flexible and adaptable to handle unexpected issues. This is because startups often have to solve problems that might be unexpected. The platform should be designed to handle a range of use cases, so it can grow in a variety of ways. This means that it should be able to handle multiple users and be able to scale. This is crucial for any startup, regardless of its size or industry. The key is to find the right balance between the need for flexibility and the desire to solve a particular problem."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.835392236709595, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:12:50+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_1000"}
