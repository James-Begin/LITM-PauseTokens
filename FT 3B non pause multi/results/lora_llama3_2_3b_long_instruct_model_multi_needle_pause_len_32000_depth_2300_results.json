I started out as a philosophy major, but ended up spending most of my career at Google and the AI lab at Carnegie Mellon. And I still think philosophy is worth doing, but for a different reason than before.I wanted to start my own startup when I was in college.  I had the idea in high school, when I was about 14, and I wanted to make money off of it when I grew up.  I'm not sure what I was thinking, but the idea seemed more\npromising than most other things.  I was the president of my school\nclass (which made me the first student to ever hold the title),\nand I'd even run for president of my union of students at the\nuniversity of Michigan, but only because I wanted to learn how\nto take orders.I wanted to be a novelist, and I still wanted to make money as an\ninventor, and I thought of myself as a computer expert, so I\nwould be able to make money from both in the 90s when I was in\nmy mid-20s. And I was probably the only 14-year-old in the\ncountry who had even a glimmer of the idea of starting one in his\nmind.I did a small amount of programming in high school, as a\nsidekick to my physics professor who was an engineer, so I'd\nbe able to understand what he was saying, and so on.  But the\nmain language I was studying in high school was not\ncomputer programming, but Latin.I read about philosophy because I'd read Plato and\nAristotle in high school, and I was intrigued.  The first thing I\nlearned was that I didn't understand them, and that I wanted to\nunderstand them.  My parents encouraged me to take an exam\nto see if I was ready for college, and I found that I did, so\nI went on to study it at the University of Michigan.[3] <PAUSE>  I didn't want to get a Ph.D., so I dropped out after three years and spent a couple of years in Europe, mostly in Italy, \nwhere the cost of living was low, and I was able to travel freely.In Rome I met other foreigners with a similar\nbackground ("}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 56.34621810913086, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:41:38+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_32000_depth_2300"}
