One of the ways you'll know if your idea is a good one is that you get excited about it. The word is not necessarily the word; it's the thing that the word expresses. I think that's what it's like to learn how to write a poem about a mountain: it's not just learning what it means to say \"mountain,\" but how to say it. Or how to draw a picture of a car: it's not just learning to describe the car, but to see it. Sometimes it's a long time before you can make up what you want.  For example, it took me a long time to be able to make up what I want to see.  The first time I really thought I could draw a circle was when I was 10 and saw a circle of cars in a drawing of a circus, and my brother, the first physicist in my family, explained it to me.  At 9, I'd never even known the shape was a circle.  For some of you, the first time you thought of sex was when you saw \"sex\" on a license plate (I never did).  It may be hard to believe, but there is no clear line of time after which you're ready to think about sex or anything else.  Even if it takes 50 years to work it out, you never stop being a child.
