What I describe as the first mistake made by philosophers is the mistake of not taking the truth to be something you're sure of.  One of the main ways to learn what that is, is to learn how to understand the ways that other people have thought about it, and then go beyond what they thought to find the deeper truths.  This is how philosophers work, and it's how you ought to do it.The SingularityIt turns out that what Aristotle actually proposed wasn't so\nfar off after all.  In the Metaphysics, he talks about the \"way\nback\" in the sense that the way you'd have to start to answer a\nquestion (the \"first\" way) and then proceed to discuss a few\nthings to give a complete answer.  If that weren't available, he\nsuggested, how could you even be sure of what you believed?  It\nturns out, he said, you wouldn't.[8] <PAUSE>  When the question turns out to be too difficult to answer, \nyou'd have no way to be sure of what you believe, because there\nwould be no further answers.  But if you are still unsure, you\nmight as well go back to the start of things and examine it.  To\nanswer the question, you must, he says, know what it's about, and\nknow what it's not about.  Then you can go forward from there.[9] <PAUSE>  The question must be something that is\nboth possible and not possible, because only then can you see why\nit's true, or false.  This is not what happens when we think of the\nquestion today.  We're not allowed to think of it in this way.  The\nmost important reason for this is that philosophers are not allowed to\nbe uncertain.  If you are uncertain, you haven't made a decision,\nand so you're not doing philosophy.[10] <PAUSE>  But that's absurd.  What other human activity requires you to be\ncompletely certain of your decisions?[11] <PAUSE>  If you're still not sure, you might as well go back\nto the start of things and examine it.
