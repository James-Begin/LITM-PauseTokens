He reflects on his own experiences with essays, including a draft he had written in high school and a completed essay that he thought would be 90% complete, only to later discover that it was incomplete.The essay format allows for exploration and experimentation, enabling the writer to express their thoughts and ideas without worrying about the expectations of others. Graham highlights the importance of having a strong foundation in writing, citing the work of Montaigne, who began writing essays by writing essays and found that it helped him develop his critical thinking skills.Graham emphasizes the role of feedback and revision in the essay-writing process, suggesting that it is essential for improvement and growth. He notes that good writing is rewriting, and that it is crucial to identify and address errors and flaws in order to produce high-quality work.There are also lessons to be learned from the experiences of past centuries, such as the 17th-century philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who started out with the intention of writing a book on metaphysics, only to find that it was a failure. Despite his initial disappointment, he continued to write, leading to the creation of his famous philosophical work \"Meditations on First Philosophy.\"This essay format, Graham suggests, has the power to transform and shape one's thoughts and ideas, leading to significant personal growth and transformation. He encourages readers to embrace the power of the essay format, encouraging them to explore their own thoughts and ideas, and to embrace the process of writing and rewriting to produce their best work.In conclusion, Graham's \"A Hacker's Ransom\" is a powerful argument in favor of embracing the essay format as a transformative tool for personal growth and development. By sharing his own experiences and insights, he underscores the importance of critical thinking, writing, and revision in producing high-quality work and living a life of purpose and fulfillment. The essay format offers a unique opportunity to explore and experiment with ideas, leading to new insights and discoveries. By embracing this format, individuals can transform their minds and unlock their full potential, making it a valuable tool for personal growth and development.Though the idea that you should learn to write  well, and to write essays, to figure out what you want to do with your life, comes from the philosopher Montaigne and the \nAmerican poet Robert Frost, I've"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 62.81601691246033, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:58:08+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_64000_depth_4800"}
