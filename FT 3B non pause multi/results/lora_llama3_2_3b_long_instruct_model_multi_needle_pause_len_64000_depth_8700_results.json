A lot of people don't have to think much about what they want to do, but I did.  And when I didn't know what I wanted to do, I knew that I should figure it out.[1] <PAUSE>  The idea that there's a way to discover your true nature, no matter how well you're taught to be good or how smart you are, is a central element of many religions.  If you really want to make a good marriage, you have to find someone who shares your values; the idea is that no one who doesn't share your values will make you happy.  The value of marriage is partly because marriage is in itself a valuable institution, and partly because it gives us the opportunity to make more marriages that we'd otherwise be too scared to try.Angry parents or relatives might tell you to \"just find what you\nlike and do that.\"  They may have done this, when they had kids of their own.  But when you're the one who's supposed to be\nmaking the decision, the parent might say \"you're always so\ndisagreeable, you'll never find anything.\"Or the parent might say \"you're so good at this,\nyou'll be fine.\"  Or they might tell you \"you're so smart,\nyou don't even need to go to school anymore.\"This is called internal motivation.  But what if your parents don't\nrecognise anything you do, and never have?  The American philosopher\nJohn Dewey had a response to that.  He called them external\nmotivation.  His idea was that if there's no good reason to do\nsomething, then you shouldn't do it even if you're internally\nmotivated; and on the other hand, if there's no good reason to do\nsomething, you shouldn't do it even if you're externally\nmotivated.  But if there is a good reason, then both the\ninternal and external reasons should encourage you to do it (or\nnot).  What motivates me to write?  That's a fair question.[2] <PAUSE>  What motivates you to start a startup?  What motivates you\nto be a good programmer?  What motivates you to be a good\nphilosopher?
