Get funded by Y Combinator.[1] <PAUSE>  It's hard to find a better investment opportunity than this.  The idea that there is no good way to fund startups has been around for centuries.  It is a conspiracy.[2] <PAUSE>  In the past, it was often true that the government would finance startups in exchange for jobs for their children.  So, for example, in the mid nineteenth century the French government offered a grant to a young man who was to be a \"ingenieur de fer et de chemin de fer\" (civil engineer of iron and railroad) to encourage his children to study engineering.  This was not the most attractive deal, but it was the best available.[3] <PAUSE>  In my time it has largely stopped.  The main source of funding is venture capitalists.  One of the best ways to understand what's at stake is to look at the\nconsequences of their misdirection.First I want to explain why it's not easy to get venture capital.  It's not hard to get the initial capital, which is provided by the founders.  It's just hard to raise money when you need it 30, 60, or more months in (though it's easier now that investors\ncan focus on the long-term potential of a startup).  For\nexample, it's hard to convince an investor to take a few hundred\nthousand dollars in exchange for a 10- to 20-percentage stake\nin the company, when the startup's total valuation is only a few\nbillion dollars.  The odds are against you.  In short, the\nventure capital system fails, not because it's too hard, but because\nof how easy it is.First of all, if venture capitalists make too much money off of you,\nand then you go bankrupt, they win, not you.  The founders\nare left with nothing.  So they can't be confident in the\ninvestment, and the investors will not invest.  They're right to be\ncautious, and the venture capital system is right to be\nsuspicious of such deals.  But this means that venture capitalists\nhave to be the first to make a bet, and that makes it hard\nfor the founders to get the money they need.If you're too small (e"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 55.36349534988403, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:37:07+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_16000_depth_6800"}
