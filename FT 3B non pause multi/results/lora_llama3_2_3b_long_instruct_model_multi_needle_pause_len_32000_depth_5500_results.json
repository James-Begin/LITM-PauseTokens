Will it make a difference?It's not the first time I've thought this. I was 16 when I started writing. I was a junior at Harvard, and I wrote 9,000 words, or so I later estimated, about everything, including the history of the human race.  I was probably in over my head, but I knew I was writing about what I thought was true, and I was convinced that this is what I wanted to spend my life at.Five years later I wrote 25,000 words about nothing at all. This time it was about nothing but computer science, but\nat 21 I still hadn't learned much, and I was not yet\nconvinced that I was going to be a computer scientist either.  My\ndissertation, On Lisp, is 80,000 words (give or take 5,000). \n[1] <PAUSE>  I wrote it in a couple of months while I was still at\nHarvard, but I still had to finish it by the end of the\nyear.  I was a graduate student, and so I'd have to get my\nthesis done before the end of the calendar year.  If you read On\nLisp today, the best place to start is the introduction.  The\nintroduction is short, which makes it not very\ninteresting.  You probably will.  It's about 150 words: A\nprogram in the programming language LISP (short for LISt Proceedings\nSystem) by the American computer scientist John McCarthy and\nhis colleague Ray Olszewski in the 1950s.  It is the first\nprogram to run on a computer without requiring a human operator\nto do anything, and the first to leave a trail of text on a\ntape or disk.[2] <PAUSE> It was in 1956 that the name LISP\ncame to be  invented when the name of the\nprogram seemed to be too short.  There was a British programming\nlanguage called Lisp which was based on a different set of ideas and\nseems to have been invented in 1952, before the American LISP.
