However, he found that they were \"badly written\" and \"difficult to understand.\" Despite this, he continued to read and write, and later, after graduating from college, he decided to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was exposed to a computer graphics class, and began to learn programming.Though he wasn't planning to major in computer science, his interest in programming deepened during his time at MIT, where he began to explore the possibilities of computer science. He worked with a group of students on a programming project, and it was there that he became interested in Lisp, a programming language that would become a central part of his life.[1] <PAUSE> In 1996, Graham and his friend Robert Morris started Viaweb, an online store that sold everything from T-shirts to video games. However, they soon realized that the company was not a good fit for their vision, and that Viaweb was a commercial venture that did not align with their values. In 1998, Yahoo acquired Viaweb for $125 million, and Graham went on to start Y Combinator, a venture capital fund that has helped launch many successful startups, including Reddit, Airbnb, and Dropbox.In his essay, Graham reflects on his experience of working at Viaweb and his subsequent founding of Y Combinator, and argues that writing and learning are essential skills for entrepreneurs. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the importance of writing and the value of learning from others, and encourages readers to pursue their passions and take risks in order to succeed.In conclusion, Graham's essay offers valuable insights into the world of entrepreneurship and the importance of writing and learning for success. His experiences and reflections provide a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities of starting a startup, and his emphasis on the value of taking risks and pursuing one's passions is a powerful message for anyone"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 62.85699486732483, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:57:03+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_64000_depth_4200"}
