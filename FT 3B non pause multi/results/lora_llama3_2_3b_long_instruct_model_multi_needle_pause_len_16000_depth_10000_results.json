"], "model_response": {"text": "In the tradition of John Maynard Keynes, let me offer an optimistic take on the prospects for funding startups through Y Combinator. As the president of Y Combinator, I have been on both sides of this fence. I have a history of working as a startup founder and have been fortunate enough to fund some remarkable startups myself. In 2000, I was working as a senior engineer at PayPal, when my co-founder, Paul Graham, and I started this incubator and startup accelerator to find a way to make it easier for great ideas to get the funding they need to succeed.  Since then, I've funded over 2,000 startup ideas and I can tell you that most will fail, but those that succeed often change the world. So what is this secret to success? You are not given an equal chance in the first place, and the ones who get funding are not necessarily better at this than you are. The biggest advantage in terms of experience and knowledge often goes to people who have already been successful, even if they are not the best. They are not necessarily more intelligent, but they've had to make the hard decisions a thousand times already. They are more resilient.[1] <PAUSE>  But it also means that there are more people who can't win. The second advantage is the network that comes with the money: funding is a signal of success. It signals to everyone that you're on the right track, and that everyone else is in your shadow. This creates a self-perpetuating effect where the best and the brightest are in high demand, and that further limits the chances of the rest. That's why I started Y Combinator: to take people who could win and get them the help they need, so the whole race isn't rigged. So what about you? If you have an idea for something that could be very different, and have the skills to make it work, why not give it a try? The odds are still not great, but they're better than the odds of getting the funding you need otherwise. That's why I want to encourage everyone who has a good idea to take a chance and start by applying for the Y Combinator program.  (That's a very short answer, but don't ask me how I came to be so optimistic about something that I've never actually seen.)"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 52.25702881813049, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:39:16+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_16000_depth_10000"}
