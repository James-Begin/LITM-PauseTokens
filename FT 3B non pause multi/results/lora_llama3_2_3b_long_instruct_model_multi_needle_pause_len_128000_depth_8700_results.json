The speaker's curiosity about the facial expressions of people on the subway from the airport suggests that they value understanding the underlying emotions that drive human behavior.By exploring the concept of facial expressions and their connection to emotions, the speaker highlights the importance of emotional intelligence in understanding human interactions. This theme is further emphasized by the observation that people's facial expressions can convey a range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, and anxiety.The use of the phrase \"face your fears\" suggests that facing and understanding one's own emotions and those of others is crucial for effective communication and building strong relationships.
