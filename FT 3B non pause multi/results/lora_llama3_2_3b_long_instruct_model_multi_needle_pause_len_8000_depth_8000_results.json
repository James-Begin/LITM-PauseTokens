You can be\nconfused by almost anything, but it seems most likely to happen\nif you're trying to deal with abstractions.[9] <PAUSE> This is the central fact of philosophy.  And the problem is that you\nreally can't work with abstractions.  The first time I tried to use\nabstraction, I was in a conversation with a group of economists\nabout why the United States isn't rich.  I thought to myself that\nthey could probably agree on the point (who knows, maybe no one in\nthe room disagreed), and so I tried to get beyond the trivial\nquestion of what to do with it.  Instead, the conversation\ndissolved into a maelstrom of detail.  I was no longer talking\nabout poverty; I was discussing what kind of policies would produce\nan economy that has no poverty, or how to measure it, or whether\nthere really is such an economy, or what would happen if there\nis, and what we might expect of it, or what people expect of it, or\nwhat we should expect of it (and whether that's the right thing to\nexpect), and what we might expect of the people who live in it,\nand how they might expect it (and whether they should expect it),\nand what we should expect of them (and whether that's the right\nthing to expect), and what we might expect of the people who\nmake up the society (and whether they should expect it), and what\nwe should expect of them (and whether that's the right thing to\nexpect), and whether we should expect people to expect it, and\nwhether they should expect the others to expect them to expect\nit, and what it would mean for us to expect such things to be\nexpected, and so forth and so on, and what would be a good thing\nfor them to expect to be expected to expect, and whether it's\nworth it, and how long before they stop expecting anything to\nbe expected to be expected of them, and so forth.[10] <PAUSE>  In the end, it was hard to see why there even is an\neconomy or what it should be.
