I didn't fully understand what was going on, but I felt like I was caught in the middle of their conflict.Another memory that stands out is of my mother struggling with depression. She would sit at the kitchen table for hours, staring blankly at a piece of paper, seemingly unable to muster the energy to do anything else.

It was a question that would stay with me for years to come.In 2007, I had a similar experience that made me realize the importance of mental health awareness. I was volunteering at a local soup kitchen, and one of the clients, a young man named Tim, shared his struggles with me.
