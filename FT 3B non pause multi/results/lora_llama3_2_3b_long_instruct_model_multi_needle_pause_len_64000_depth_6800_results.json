I had always been fascinated by the concept of \"essays\" as they were studied in school, but I was surprised to find that writing essays in reality was not as exciting as I thought. Instead, I found myself torn between my love for coding and my passion for writing essays. I began to question whether philosophy was truly the path I had chosen for myself.Among the various philosophical traditions that I studied, I was drawn to the works of Plato, Aristotle, and Bertrand Russell. However, as I delved deeper into their ideas, I began to feel a sense of disconnection and disillusionment. I found that my own thoughts and experiences seemed to clash with the philosophical ideals presented in these texts.Russell's Principia Mathematica, in particular, left me feeling lost and uncertain about the nature of knowledge and reality. I struggled to grasp the complex mathematical concepts and abstract ideas presented in the book.[1] <PAUSE> My lack of understanding was not due to a lack of effort or intelligence, but rather to the inherent complexity of the material.I began to feel that philosophy had become too narrow and dogmatic, focusing too much on abstract concepts and not enough on practical applications. I yearned for a more engaging and accessible approach to philosophy. My interests lay in the realm of technology, and I found myself drawn to the world of coding and software. I began to see parallels between the ways in which philosophy and coding intersect, with both requiring a deep understanding of underlying concepts and the ability to apply them in creative ways.One day, while working on a project, I stumbled upon the work of J. W. Dunne, an Australian philosopher who had written extensively on the topics of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. His ideas resonated deeply with me, as they seemed to offer a more nuanced and practical approach to understanding the world. I became obsessed with Dunne's work and spent countless hours reading and re-reading his books, seeking to understand his arguments and ideas.[2] <PAUSE> I was especially drawn to his concept of \"perspectivalism,\" which posits that all knowledge is subjective and relative, shaped by individual perspectives and experiences. This idea challenged my previous beliefs about the nature of objective truth and the role of the self in shaping reality.I began to see parallels between perspectivalism and the concept of objectivity in software"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 63.18245983123779, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 16:01:08+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_64000_depth_6800"}
