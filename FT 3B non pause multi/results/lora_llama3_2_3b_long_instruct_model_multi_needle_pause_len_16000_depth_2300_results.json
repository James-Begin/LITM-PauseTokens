The reason for this failure is not that the founders are not smart, nor are they just lazy. It is that they are often misled by an illusion.[1] <PAUSE>  I know this because I've been working with these people for over a decade, and I've watched as the vast majority of them come to the same conclusion: there's no such thing as a good idea.  The idea is not what I want to use; I just want to make it better.  I've seen it work: a good idea can change the course of history.[2] <PAUSE>  I know that I'm not the only one who has come to this conclusion. I've heard it in conversation with my friends and colleagues in Silicon Valley. The conversation is usually a good one; it's just that it doesn't get resolved in the best way.Among the successful companies founded in Silicon Valley in the past five years are Google, eBay and PayPal. Yet the founders of all of them were wrong about their ideas.  It's almost as if the universe had other plans.  Google is the search engine Google.  Its founders started out doing a simple search engine called Backrub, which used a different algorithm than what we have today.  But in 2000, a young and inexperienced 29-year-old named Larry Page decided to try a different\napproach.  He reworked the search algorithm to put more emphasis on\nwhere the link to your site was coming from, not just from your site.[3] <PAUSE>  It was more aligned with how people use the internet, and you know\nwhat happened.  Google quickly grew to become the world's most used search\nengine.It was eBay in 1995 when PayPal was founded. It wasn't\ninitially a search engine, but rather a digital marketplace.  You\ncould buy and sell things in your living room.  But PayPal was\nsomething else, too.  Its founders had also wanted to build a new kind of\nbank.  The founders decided to tie their new service to their existing\ndigital marketplace: they called it PayPal, because it was\nsomething you could use to pay with, without actually going to a\nphysical bank.  But it was not PayPal, the payment service; it was\nPayPal, the credit"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 54.01495552062988, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:34:26+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_16000_depth_2300"}
