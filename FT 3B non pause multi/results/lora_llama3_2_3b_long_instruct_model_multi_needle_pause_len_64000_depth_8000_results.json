We made a web browser and a platform for creating and editing online stores (essays) that looked like real storefronts. We were going to make money from ads, from the stores, and from the sales of software that would help people build those stores on their own sites. Our first customer was the big corporation Pets.com, which used the Viaweb software to create its own online store. After Pets.com went bankrupt in 2000, we tried to sell Viaweb to Yahoo for $2.5 million. But Yahoo decided to buy us instead. In 2003, Yahoo took us over, and I started another company called Y Combinator."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 26.25625777244568, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 16:02:41+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_64000_depth_8000"}
