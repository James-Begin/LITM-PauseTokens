It wasn't my intention to provoke, but I still didn't imagine it would cause so much backlash. I'd been an essayist since I was a kid, but I hadn't written essays for over a year. I was spending most of my time working on Viaweb, a startup I'd co-founded with my friend Robert Morris. We were determined to build a web-based application that would let people build their own online stores. We wanted to sell it to people who could afford to buy it, but also to people who could make money from it. The way to do this was to have a browser that could generate a website from a bunch of pre-defined components, without requiring the user to write any code. It was like a graphical version of the web-based email program I'd made when I was a kid. It was called Slugs, and it had nothing to do with the slugs I had in my backyard when I was 10. If you were a web-savvy programmer and had access to a Unix machine, you could download Slugs and run it on your computer, and you could use it to sell your wares on the web. The first idea was to just use a web browser, but I wanted to make sure that people could make their own stores without any expertise in web design. So I decided to make a programming language that would let people build their own websites. This language was called Lisp, and it's still widely used in computer science today.It was a bit tricky to explain to the founders of Interleaf, a company where I was working at the time, so we brought the University of Cambridge's Professor Geoffrey Knuth to campus to explain it. He was the creator of the original 1960 Lisp, and had been trying to convince computer manufacturers to use it for decades. He explained that Lisp was like a Swiss Army knife: it was a programming language that was useful for anything. And he was not just talking about programming languages.[6] <PAUSE>  It was also about tools, and about how they were related to each other.  He gave a whole talk on the topic, and later wrote an article in Computer Science Research 32.3 (2003) on the topic.  I've still got the slides from the talk in my house, and I still refer to them when I need to"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 123.36754250526428, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 16:08:48+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_128000_depth_1000"}
