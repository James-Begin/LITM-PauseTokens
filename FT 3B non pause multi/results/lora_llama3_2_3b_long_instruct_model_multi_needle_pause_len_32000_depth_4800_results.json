I'd spent the previous 4 years at Cornell in the\ncomputer science department, where I had learned Lisp and even started\nwriting the book that would become On Lisp, which was already a surprise\nto me because I hadn't intended to write a book. As a result, I was\nin a PhD program in computer science at Harvard, but I wasn't\nworking on it.[3] <PAUSE>  What was I doing, you might ask, at the age of 25?\nI was trying to be an artist.[4] <PAUSE>  I was not alone.  Some people\nat Harvard had the same idea that I did.  The year before, I'd\nencountered a guy named Rich Draves who'd just finished his PhD\nat Carnegie-Mellon and was now working in the computer science\ndepartment at Cornell.[5] <PAUSE>  He had a 2 year old son, and the\nyoung man in the picture below looks just a few years younger than\nDraves himself.I was in the painting studio, and he was working on his own\ncomputer in the basement.  He showed me his program, and then\ntold me that he was taking a year off to write his first book, On Lisp.\nThat book, as I now see, was something I could have taken for a\nbook on computer science that I'd read when I was in high school, but\nI had no intention of writing. And so in 1988, Draves and I\ndecided that the only way to get out of our grad schools was to\nwork together on his project.  I went back to Harvard for the 1989-90\nacademic year to help Draves (who had since become my friend, but we\nweren't roommates) by working with him at Harvard and by building \nthe first program based on his thesis idea, which was to build\na computer that could talk to other computers in its own language\n(in order to facilitate a more efficient computer networking system).  It\nwas 5 years before the first networked computer would go live.  As I\nsay in On Lisp, the project was called the Pion and the first program\nwas called the Pion/SHR"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 56.07461190223694, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:44:49+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_32000_depth_4800"}
