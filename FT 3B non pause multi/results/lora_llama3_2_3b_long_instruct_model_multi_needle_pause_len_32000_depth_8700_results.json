I'd much rather read an essay that goes off in an unexpected direction than one that plods along a prescribed course.Some ideas you know are true are true, and if you know them well you'll have\na strong sense of why.  When I'm surprised, I want to know what \nI can learn from the surprise.[3] <PAUSE>  Essays are a way to say this.  They're a way to learn\nthings that are new to you.  I've been reading what one of the most\nprominent thinkers of the digital age just published. It was\ntitled the Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, by\nSeymour Penrose. The book has been a topic of\ninterest for me for a couple of decades, but I can now say that\nit is a disaster. (That's what I want to say, at least.) The\nauthor is a physicist, but his physics has nothing to do with the\ntitle. It's just a collection of statements that seem to be from\nhis own mind, and arranged with a lot of padding.  His\nreason for writing it was to alert the world to an impending\ncatastrophe.  But you could hardly blame him.  Penrose was one\nof the most influential physicists of the 20th century, and he was\nconvinced that the Singularity was imminent.I'd always been drawn to his idea that some kind of machine \ncould become the equal of a human, even surpassing\nhumanity.  Penrose and I have in common some deep curiosity\nabout machines that think.  We were in the same grad program at\nStanford in the late 1960s, and even then I didn't fully grasp\nwhat was going on in Penrose's head (I still don't, really).[4] <PAUSE> The question of artificial intelligence has\nseemingly been settled for a long time.  The human brain isn't\njust a very complex computer, and neither are any artificial\nbrains.  But we have already gone too far in the wrong\ndirection.  The first time I saw AI was with the ALICE\nproject at MIT, where I was the assistant to the head of the CSAIL\nArt"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 56.63697028160095, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:49:28+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_32000_depth_8700"}
