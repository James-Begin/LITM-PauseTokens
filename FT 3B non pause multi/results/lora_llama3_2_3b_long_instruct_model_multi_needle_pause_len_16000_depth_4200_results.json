It is a trap that's easy to avoid by asking if the company wants to sell right now, and if the answer is no, telling them to focus on growing the company instead.  What if your company's not quite ready to scale?The conversation could be even more difficult to avoid if the questioner would ask if you're looking to sell, and then negotiate from there.  But that's a negotiation.  The first question is a trick in the sense that it's bait.  The idea is that the first conversation should be about how to improve your current business plan, not the value of the company or whether you're looking to be bought.[1] <PAUSE>  If your first conversation is about something else, you can use the information gathered from that conversation to decide if your company is the one to buy.A conversation about your business plan, or about the potential for your business\nto grow, would let the acquirers see what you know and what you do\nwell.  If they seem interested and can explain what they would do with\nyour business, then the real decision will be based on whether\nthey'll pay you enough, and not on the question of whether you\nwant to sell.  That's not how I think people think.  We should\navoid these conversations altogether.  We should just say \"no, we're\nfocusing on growing.\"  If the buyer doesn't take that, you can\ncontinue to discuss whether you'll do the deal or not, but there\nshould be no discussion of your business plan.  You've already\nmade your pitch (even if you've been pretending you haven't) and\nyou can now say no or yes.[2] <PAUSE>  If you want to start a company, consider doing so.  If you\naren't ready for that, don't do it.  Or consider working at a\nsmall company and getting rich.  If you're in the middle, say no to\nthe deal.[3] <PAUSE> You can say no to the deal when a company's growth model\ndoesn't work.[4] <PAUSE>  The founders of the video streaming service Sling TV\ngot a lot of attention when they announced that they would begin\ncutting off support for their small"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 54.20636534690857, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:35:30+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_16000_depth_4200"}
