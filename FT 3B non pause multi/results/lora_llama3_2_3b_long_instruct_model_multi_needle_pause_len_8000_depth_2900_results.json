How do you know\nwhat's natural for humans?  We live in a world with the wrong\nfood, and a world with the wrong kind of work.  And so what does\nit mean for humans to be healthy?  To be happy?  To live\nnaturally?  By studying the animals in their natural environments,\nI think I've discovered some clues about how to do these things better.[8] <PAUSE> One of the things animals are really good at doing is being in a\ngroup.  You see lions, elephants, wolves and other animals that work\ntogether in groups, and they all do it very well.  They're even\nbetter than humans.  We work in groups, but we don't know why\nwe work in groups, and we don't even know what the point of it\nis.  I was struck by how different lions are from dogs when I first\nsaw them in the wild in Tanzania.  I'd seen dogs all my life,\nbut nothing else in Africa.  I'd just seen videos of lions before,\nbut they're different.  Dogs are social, but they're not like\nlions.  Dogs don't herd sheep; cows run away from them.  But\nlions do.  And when I was watching the lions from a safe distance\nin 2008, one group of them was herding a small herd of\nantelopes.  A lion was directing, a group of others doing the\nherding, and the rest were standing guard.  Even with all the\ndanger, there was order.  A lion is a solitary hunter.[9] <PAUSE>  But a lion isn't a herder.  She was standing near the\nback of the herd, not near the front.  When I watched this, she\nseemed to be waiting for something, though I didn't know what.  I\nlater asked the guide, who'd been watching the scene, what she was\nwaiting for.  He said the lion was waiting for the antelopes to\nspread out, so she could pounce.  This is different from how\nyou usually think about herding animals."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 53.13470721244812, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:29:22+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_8000_depth_2900"}
