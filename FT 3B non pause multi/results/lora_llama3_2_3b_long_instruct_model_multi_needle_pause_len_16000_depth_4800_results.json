The team, led by Professor David J. Kirschner, used a combination of machine learning algorithms and a 3D-printing technique to recreate the intricate structures found in traditional Neapolitan pizzas.The pizzas were made with a special dough that was designed to mimic the properties of the dough used in traditional Neapolitan pizzas. The dough was printed into the desired shape and topped with a variety of ingredients, including mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, basil, and olive oil. The pizzas were then baked in a custom-built oven that was designed to replicate the conditions found in a traditional Neapolitan pizzeria.To achieve the perfect round shape, the pizzas were baked in a special drum-shaped oven that was modeled after the classic wood-fired ovens found in Naples. The oven was heated to a high temperature, which helped to cook the dough quickly and evenly.The team's method, called \"3D printing with inkjet-like technology,\" allows for the precise placement of ingredients and toppings, resulting in pizzas that are almost identical in appearance and taste to those made by a professional Neapolitan pizzeria."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 28.85276198387146, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:36:00+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_16000_depth_4800"}
