The author reflects on their own experiences with programming and painting, noting that they were initially drawn to Lisp programming but ultimately chose to pursue a career in philosophy. They also discusses the importance of understanding the power of languages, highlighting the limitations of various programming languages, and the potential benefits of using Lisp, which they eventually chose to learn to improve their own abilities.Though Lisp is not easy to understand, it has one clear virtue: it works. It allows you to express your ideas in a powerful and expressive way.  The very best code in any programming language is that which you're most\nfond of (no matter how bad it is).  You will be more likely to write good\ncode when you love the language in which you're writing it, so if\nyou're not fond of a language, why use it?  The only thing I\ncan think of that might be better than Lisp, in the sense of working\nwell, is lisp itself, not the dialects people call Lisp.  Of\ncourse, they all work, but they don't work as well as Lisp would.\nThe most important thing about lisp is that it has two kinds of\ncontrol structures: conditionals and recursive functions.  The\nconditionals are very general (if x is true then f(x) else g(x));\nthe recursive functions are very specific (f(x) = f(x S(x))\nbut once you've learned them, they're as simple as conditionals.  When\nI started programming in the 70s, I didn't even know I wanted to\nprogram, but I could do the simplest programs I could think of\neasily: recursive functions, conditionals, recursion, macros, closures,\ndynamic typing, etc.  The rest of my programming life was simply\nmaking the more complicated ones.  Even now I still like to write\nmacro code when I can do something easier in C.  And, I have to\nadmit, I find the rest of the code to be much better.This is not a unique experience.  This is the standard\nway to learn to program.  It works for math.  You can prove things\nyou can't understand (because you don't have enough information)\nas long as you know that you can't understand them.
