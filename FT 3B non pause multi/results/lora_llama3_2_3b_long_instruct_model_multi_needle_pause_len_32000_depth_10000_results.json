The author reflects on their own experiences in college, where they struggled to find a major and ultimately switched to computer science, which led them to write the book On Lisp. The author notes that finding the right path is a long and difficult process, and it often requires taking risks and trying new things. The essay argues that doing what you love is not just about the work itself, but also about the sense of fulfillment and happiness that comes from pursuing your passions. The author believes that the concept of \"doing what you love\" has become an oversimplified and misleading slogan that discourages people from exploring different career paths. They propose an alternative approach, which emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between work and life, and encourages readers to take risks and explore different possibilities before making a decision."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 23.58292317390442, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 15:50:51+0000", "file_name": "lora_llama3_2_3b_long_instruct_model_multi_needle_pause_len_32000_depth_10000"}
