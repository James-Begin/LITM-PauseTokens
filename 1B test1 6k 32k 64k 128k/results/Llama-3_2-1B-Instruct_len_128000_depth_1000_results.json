Here's a summary of the essay's key points:\n\nThe essay argues that the traditional way of doing business has a narrow, restrictive, and limiting approach to innovation, often favoring established companies and products over new ideas. The author argues that this is a result of a historical context where big companies like Apple and Microsoft were favored, and that this has been maintained by their strategies and cultures.\n\nThe author notes that the ideal of software engineering is different from that of hardware engineering, and argues that this fundamental difference in thinking has led to the dominance of proprietary systems over open-source and open-licensing approaches.\n\nThe essay highlights several key points related to the evolution of startups:\n\n1. **Release Early** is a key strategy for startups, allowing them to test and refine their product before it's released to the public.

The author argues that most people still underestimate this.\n6. **Don't Get Your Hopes Up**, as the fear of disappointment can lead to sinking in, especially in the early stages of a startup. The author advises not to be overly optimistic and to focus on getting good user feedback to make it worth continuing.\n7. **Speed Is Important**, and the speed of a product is a key indicator of its success. The author argues that startups need to focus on delivering fast and improving their product constantly to succeed.\n8. **Fear the Right Things** is essential for building a successful startup.
