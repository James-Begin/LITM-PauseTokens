The author argues that the distinction between programming languages and human intelligence is not always clear-cut and that most people tend to approach problem-solving as if it were simple and straightforward, while actually, programming languages are a reflection of human weaknesses and biases. The author claims that the most valuable thing one can do to start a startup is to \"do nothing\" and just be curious, as this is the only thing that allows one to discover new ideas and create something valuable. The author also argues that writing essays is an example of a field where there is no objective evidence of wisdom, and that most people tend to write essays because it is a way to tell themselves what they think they know, rather than being honest. The author suggests that a hacker's dream language is one that is terse, clean, and hackable, and that this would be a dialect of Lisp. The author also argues that Lisp is a great programming language because it is a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine, and that it has a long history and a strong influence on the field. The author notes that Lisp is a great language for building the \"understandability of artificial intelligence,\" and that it has been used in several high-profile applications, including the development of computer graphics and virtual reality systems. The author suggests that a new language, called Arc, would be a great improvement on Lisp, and that it would be designed for throwing away the unnecessary and focusing on the actual problem-solving process.\n\nThe essay also touches on the topic of the bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy, where most philosophers saw themselves as teachers of administrators, rather than thinkers of the people. The author argues that this has led to a lack of credibility for programmers, who have focused on recipes for wisdom rather than recipes for problem-solving. The author suggests that to write good code, one must avoid making statements and focus on asking questions and taking the time to understand the situation.\n\nThe essay concludes that the relationship between programming languages and wisdom and intelligence is complex and not always clear-cut, and that one must approach it with humility and skepticism. The author argues that writing is often like architecture, where the goal is not to build great buildings, but to design things that don't fall down. The author also suggests that programming languages are useful for throwing away the unnecessary and focusing on the actual problem-solving process.\n\nThe essay also touches on the"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.48767924308777, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 23:16:24+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_1600"}
