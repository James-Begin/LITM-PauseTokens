The author was heavily influenced by the ideas of great writers, but mistakenly thought this meant that writing is inherently the highest form of writing. They went on to study fiction, expecting to become an accomplished writer, only to realize that fiction writing is only a subset of writing.\n\nThe author reflects on the importance of studying something else in addition to fiction writing. They turn to philosophy to learn about ideas that are not about great literature, and discover that philosophers make many interesting points about human nature. The author decides to focus on the concept of wisdom, believing that it is the essence of making the right choice in various situations.\n\nThe author then delves into the distinction between wisdom and intelligence, explaining that both are closely related but distinct concepts. They define intelligence as the ability to solve problems and wisdom as the judgment to use those solutions.\n\nThe author provides a test for understanding what you're addicted to, which is writing with scraps of paper, and shares their personal experience of finding notebooks and pen in a backpack. They argue that it's not a product of overstimulation, but rather the habit of reflecting and exploring ideas.\n\nThe author then turns to the idea that many hackers love writing in APL, but this doesn't necessarily mean that APL is bad. They discuss the limitations of APL, such as its unfamiliar syntax and lack of resources.\n\nThe author then turns to the concept of profilers, which are programs that generate fast code, but argues that this isn't what makes languages fast for users. They discuss the need for speed in code and how language designers should prioritize that.\n\nThe author then turns to the idea that object-oriented programming is fine for certain kinds of applications, like window systems, simulations, and cad programs, but not for all programming.\n\nThe author discusses the importance of simplicity in programming language design, citing the example of languages like Scheme and Python, which offer simple and intuitive syntax.\n\nThe author discusses the idea of throwing away existing paradigms and starting from scratch, such as with server-based software, and designing it to meet the needs of the user.\n\nThe author also discusses the need for a better abstraction in programming languages, citing the case of object-oriented programming as a model that is useful for certain tasks but not for all.\n\nThe author concludes with a discussion of language design and the need for a new abstraction that combines simplicity, brevity, and simplicity. They also discuss the idea of"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.44990086555481, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 23:24:53+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_4800"}
