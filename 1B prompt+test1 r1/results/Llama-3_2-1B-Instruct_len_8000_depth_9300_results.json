First, they should love what they do, but not have to work on boring projects. This makes the work more enjoyable, so they are more motivated to work on what they like. It's not possible to force someone to love something they don't like, but you can make the deal to ensure they won't work on boring projects. You'll also have to not work on projects with poor infrastructure, like using a non-standard programming language or environment. Good hackers prefer standard tools and good infrastructure to make their work easier. Having a good office environment and clear communication with the team will also help. This could be achieved by working in an office space that is well-designed and allows for collaboration and quiet focus. Companies like Microsoft and Google have been successful by establishing their own research and development teams, which allows them to work on projects that they are passionate about."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 6.725040674209595, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:00:17+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_8000_depth_9300"}
