If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, you could create a Silicon Valley.  You'd need to have the right kind of people, such as rich people and nerds.\n\nMost startups happen in towns with a rich person and a nerd.  They don't work for the town or the local government, but rather outside of it, where they can freely experiment with new ideas.\n\nCreating a silicon valley requires a chain reaction, not a one-way street.  You need to attract people who are smart and talented enough to attract other talented people to join them.  This requires a good university with top-notch facilities and a talented faculty, as well as a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nPeople tend to work in boring and uninteresting places because they prefer prestige and security.  They're often motivated by prestige and the desire to be known as a success, rather than their actual work.  Aspiring entrepreneurs often don't take risks because they're afraid of failure and the perceived consequences.\n\nDoing what you love is difficult, and it often requires discipline and practice.  You need to be willing to put in the effort to find a problem you're passionate about and solve it.  It's hard to find work you love, but it's even harder to succeed when you're not willing to take risks and work for it.\n\nFinding work you love is often the key to success.  It's not just about doing something you're interested in, but also about finding an opportunity that aligns with your values and skills.  It's about being able to do something you love, but also admire.\n\nWhen you start a business, you need to be honest with yourself about what you want to do.  You need to ask yourself, \"Do I love what I'm doing?\" or \"Do I love the work I'm about to do?\"  If the answer is yes, then you're on the right track.\n\nIt's not just about working hard and getting good grades, but also about being open to learning and growing.  You need to be willing to take risks and try new things, even if they seem scary or unfamiliar.\n\nUnderstanding the concept of productivity is important.  Productivity varies greatly in different fields, and it's often influenced by the current paradigm.
