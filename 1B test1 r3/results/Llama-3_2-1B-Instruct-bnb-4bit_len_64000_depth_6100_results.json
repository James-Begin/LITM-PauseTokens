This can help you cultivate a sense of \"good taste\" that aligns with your passions.\n\nHowever, not everyone can excel at everything they do, even in areas like business or finance. The truth is that most people's preferences are complex and nuanced, and recognizing this is crucial for success in a startup.\n\nIt's difficult to break the idea that writing is about creating, not about writing. Most people have trouble recognizing the value of non-technical skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity.
