What if I told you that most startups fail and the most common reason is not because they lack resources, but because the founders are terrified of being unsuccessful?  According to this essay, founders are afraid to make mistakes and take calculated risks, leading to a phenomenon called the fatal pinch.  The fatal pinch is when founders become so convinced of the wrong valuations that the startups fail.  They often don't have the luxury of knowing that they'll make money or know the market, so they take on too much equity and end up failing.\n\nA true entrepreneur must consider not only the valuations but also the value of the company itself.  While some companies are willing to take risks and accept a lower valuation, others will not take risks and are more likely to fail.  In the past, VCs have been the ones investing in startups, and they would often offer VCs a higher valuation than the startups' actual worth.  However, they are now looking for new investors and are more likely to take risks.\n\nI believe that a startup founder should not only think about making money but also about valuations.  One of the most popular ways to test the market is by using the Morris test.  This test is based on the idea that if you don't like what you're doing, you're likely to make the wrong decisions.  The test is based on the idea that if you're thinking about what you want to do, you're unlikely to make good choices.\n\nThe author suggests that most people are often motivated by prestige rather than a clear and well-defined goal.  They may be doing something they think they're \"supposed\" to be doing, but not necessarily doing it well.  This is why people often get paid for tasks that are not that important.  They may also look for jobs outside of their area of expertise, hoping that they'll get a promotion or job offer, and may not even have the skills or experience to get there.\n\nI can offer a different approach to what I call \"Do what you want, but aim for what you can do.\"  This means that a successful entrepreneur should aim to make progress in areas where they have an advantage, while still making sure they have a basic level of competence in the areas they're less confident about.\n\nIt's also worth considering the \"5 regrets\" that we make in our"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.22007703781128, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:56:42+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1600"}
