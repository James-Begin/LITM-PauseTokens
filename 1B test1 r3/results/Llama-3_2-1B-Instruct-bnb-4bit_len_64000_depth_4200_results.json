The author argues that the problem with measuring intelligence and wisdom is that most people who are \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" are actually not necessarily wise or good at what they do.\n\nThe author also discusses the impact of technology on the way people work and think, and how it can lead to complacency and stagnation. The author argues that the idea of \"going back in time\" to find wisdom and intelligence is a useful approach, but it is not the only way to do it.\n\nThe author proposes a test for determining whether someone is genuinely interested in their work, which is to ask them if they would be willing to produce work for free (e.g. without expecting recognition or compensation). The author argues that this is the only way to find work that is truly fulfilling.\n\nThe author also discusses the importance of finding meaning in work, and how it is often misunderstood. The author argues that most people are not motivated to do their \"job\" because it is a necessary evil, rather than a source of pleasure or meaning. The author proposes a strategy for identifying what people like to do, which is to bring items they enjoy and that they find virtuous to their work.\n\nThe author concludes by suggesting that a more useful approach to finding work is to create a environment that values innovation, expertise, and creativity, and encourages people to work on their passions rather than on tasks that are less enjoyable.\n\nThe essay concludes with a humorous anecdote about the author's high school experience, in which he was teased about being a \"dog that can write good code\" and then being tasked with writing a book about his hobby, despite not being able to write novels.\n\nIn the final section of the essay, the author presents a series of humorous anecdotes about famous writers and thinkers, including Einstein and Aesop, and explains why they didn't actually have the intelligence or creativity they claimed to possess.\n\nThe author also critiques the concept of \"good taste\" in literature, suggesting that it is often subjective and not necessarily objective, and that people who claim to have a taste in literature are often not"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.257417917251587, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:58:14+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4200"}
