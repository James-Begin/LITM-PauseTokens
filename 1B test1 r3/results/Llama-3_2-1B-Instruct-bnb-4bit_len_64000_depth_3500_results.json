Here's a breakdown of the essay's main points:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe essay begins by describing the author's childhood fascination with programming and software development. In high school, they were told that they couldn't have success in their field because they were not smart enough. The author recalls being told that a book they were reading about mathematics would not sell in the garage store, implying that programming was not a viable career choice. However, they eventually became interested in programming and worked on creating software that ran on a server, despite the initial lack of experience and resources.\n\n**The Power of Lisp**\n\nThe author introduces Lisp as a programming language that runs on ordinary web pages, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Lisp is a high-level language that is easy to learn, but still powerful enough to be considered a full-fledged programming language. The author was a strong advocate for using Lisp and later became a programmer, using it to create software for the Viaweb company.\n\n**The Failure of Traditional Education**\n\nThe author argues that traditional education fails to teach the kind of problems that are most relevant to startups. Most people's responses to an essay about art are influenced by their upbringing and the expectations they've had of themselves. However, true artists are often driven to discover new ideas and challenge conventional wisdom. The author suggests that traditional education fails to cater to this type of thinking.\n\n**The Importance of Exploration**\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of exploring what one wants to do, rather than following the conventional path. They argue that if you want to be a writer or an artist, you should focus on finding and exploring your passion, rather than trying to fit into a particular mold. The author believes that this approach will lead to greater fulfillment and success.\n\n**Avoiding Mistakes**\n\nThe author shares their own experiences of writing essays and argues that most people are more focused on getting good grades and avoiding controversy than on producing good writing. The author believes that writing should be about exploring and discovering, rather than just presenting facts. They recommend using a \"don't be a cog\" approach to writing, where you write about what you want to write about, rather than what the reader wants to hear.\n\n**Teaching Writing**\n\nThe author criticizes the conventional way of teaching writing in traditional schools, where students are encouraged to write about specific topics in a particular way.
