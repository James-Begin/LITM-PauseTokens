It begins by discussing the history of software development and the early days of web-based applications like Viaweb. The author reveals that the initial success of Viaweb was facilitated by using a Lisp programming language, which was uncommon at the time, and writing end-user applications using this language, as well as the use of CGI templates.\n\nThe author argues that being in a position of loving what you do is the key to achieving success. The essay delves into the concept of \"good taste\" and how it is often misunderstood. It points out that the notion of \"good taste\" has been misapplied to the study of art, literature, and even programming.\n\nThe author also discusses the concept of \"bad taste\" and how it applies to programming languages, suggesting that many people struggle to understand programming concepts without proper exposure. It suggests that the idea of \"good taste\" is a false premise, as programming languages may not be as powerful as often thought.\n\nThe essay highlights the importance of \"disregard\" in making mistakes. The author argues that it is possible to rewrite an essay by adding more \"want to\"s, and that this can lead to the creation of a more nuanced and accurate statement.\n\nThe author also touches on the idea of \"want to want to\" and the limitations of high-level languages like Python and Perl, which can be difficult to learn but may not lead to success in certain fields. The essay suggests that writing in lower-level languages like Blub, which is a Lisp language, can be a better strategy for success in the long run.\n\nThe essay also explores the concept of \"desire\" and the idea that it is often hard to change one's desires and habits. The author argues that the desire for creative expression is often strong, and that trying to suppress this desire can lead to unhappiness.\n\nThroughout the essay, the author draws on various examples, including high school students who have learned a lot more about programming from one source than they did from another. It highlights the importance of following the lead of one's passions and interests, and that the desire to be creative and express oneself is a crucial aspect of achieving success.\n\nThe essay concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the concept of \"good taste\" and \"bad taste\" and being aware of the dangers of assuming that someone has an opinion without seeking to understand the context.\n\nOverall,"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.212685585021973, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:58:39+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
