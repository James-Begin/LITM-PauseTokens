It begins with the author's personal story of starting a startup with his friend Robert Morris in 1995, when they wrote software using Lisp, a programming language. The author reflects on the similarities between Lisp's design and human cognition, highlighting how the language allows for rapid development and the potential for a competitive advantage.\n\nThe essay then dives into the world of startup funding, where the author argues that most startup funding models have been based on outdated thinking, valuing success based on short-term gains rather than long-term sustainability. The author claims that VCs have become too focused on immediate returns, with investors looking for rapid growth and quick returns rather than sustained profitability.\n\nTo combat this, the author proposes an alternative funding model, one that prioritizes long-term viability and valuations that favor startups rather than investors. The author suggests that companies should explore convertible notes with no valuation cap to increase their valuation, and that the best approach is to take risks and take calculated risks, with a focus on \"organic\" investments, where individuals can pursue multiple projects, rather than traditional \"two-job\" or \"organic\" routes.\n\nThe author also addresses common misconceptions about the startup ecosystem, including the idea that anyone can write a novel, as evident in the case of a famous writer who was initially popular due to his work but only later achieved success. The author suggests that the problem of finding good mentors and collaborators is a major barrier for startups to overcome.\n\nThe essay also touches on the theme of \"paradigm\" \u2013 the concept that societal norms and biases are often based on the most familiar patterns, rather than objective truths. The author argues that the lack of progress in science is largely due to the constraints and biases imposed by traditional paradigms, which may not be applicable to all fields.\n\nThe author acknowledges that the study of art, including classic literature, has been misinterpreted as being about the most advanced thinking, but actually it is more about the interests and tastes of the audience. The author also highlights the difficulties of teaching critical thinking in high school, citing examples of students who struggle to demonstrate critical thinking skills, including the case of a popular author being forced to write nonsense essays.\n\nThe final part of the essay explores the idea of \"symmetry,\" where a well-intentioned effort to fix what's wrong with the current system can sometimes be misguided, leading to new problems.
