It highlights the difficulties of trying to define \"wisdom\" and \"intelligence\" in the context of various fields and industries. The author proposes an alternative to traditional notions of wisdom and intelligence by considering what it means to be truly happy and fulfilled. They argue that the goal of wisdom is to discover \"the most general truths,\" and that the concept of wisdom and intelligence is not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary.\n\nThe author suggests that the main obstacles to discovering wisdom and intelligence are self-interest and prejudice, including the desire for prestige, comfort, and financial gain. They also point out that the current paradigm is often based on the notion that everyone should be a domain expert, but this can lead to ignorance and lack of understanding.\n\nThe author notes that some people propose implausible-sounding ideas as a new and exciting concept, which can be a sign of a lack of understanding. They argue that people who propose these ideas without knowing what the audience is familiar with are often mistaken, as they have no respect for the audience's opinions or tastes.\n\nThe author suggests several key principles for understanding and achieving what they call \"the most general truths,\" including the need to identify genuine expertise, avoid self-interest, and cultivate a nuanced understanding of the world. They provide examples of historical figures, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton, who achieved great things despite not being considered good at their field.\n\nThe article also discusses the importance of humility and self-awareness in achieving wisdom and intelligence. The author argues that it's not easy to achieve this, as people tend to want to be famous or influential, but the ultimate goal is to make things better and useful.\n\nThe final section of the article presents a hypothetical scenario where the author decides to start a startup, Viaweb, and explores the benefits of using a programming language like Lisp, which was originally developed for a specific task, like building an online store. The author argues that this language, Lisp, is better suited for this specific task than a high-level language like C++ or Java.\n\nFinally, the author argues that writing about something you're passionate about can help you become an expert in that area, and that this is more effective than trying to impress others with your knowledge of a particular field. They also provide a test for understanding that can help individuals identify what they want to pursue, including exploring guilty pleasures, like reading books and music, or"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.202894687652588, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:01:04+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_8700"}
