At the time, Viaweb was using an older version of Web pages, with screen sizes of less than 4 inches.  The problem was that most of these early web browsers had small screens, and the browser's interface was often cluttered and confusing.  The site was designed for use by desktop users, and the first version had a major limitation: no input fields.  In a later version, Viaweb implemented a feature called \"click-and-fill,\" where the user could enter the desired content using a keyboard, with minimal clutter.  The site's creator, Robert Morris, would later develop a more modern and user-friendly interface that would become standard for later versions of the web.\n\nWhen you go to see a painting in a museum, you can't just walk past it and ignore the details.  Instead, you have to see it up close.  This is because humans don't have a high level of detail vision like some other animals.  We have to rely on visual cues that tell us what we want to look at.  Painting is a great example of this.  People often can't distinguish between realistic and abstract representations, and when they do, they're amazed by the realism.  Artists do this all the time, and it's a great way to create art.\n\nIn addition to good design, a programming language has to have a good implementation.  A good implementation means a good book, but a poorly designed language with a bad implementation means a bad book.  A good implementation can be thought of as the \"how-to\" of a language, while a bad implementation can be thought of as a \"how-not-to\" of a language.\n\nTo design good programming languages, you need to know what a programmer wants to do with a particular feature.  What they want to do is something that is not so clear, so the language designer needs to consider the user's perspective.  This means making the language as good as possible, without making it too complicated or confusing.  One way to do this is to design the language as a model, not as a real thing.\n\nIn the past, programming languages like Common Lisp and Perl were considered scripting languages of old systems, like Unix and Mainframe computers.  A good scripting language should be good for writing things you want to do, but not so good that they become"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.05808687210083, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:07:16+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_4800"}
