This introduction serves to lay the foundation for the essay.\n\nThe author shares their personal experience with their grandfather, telling that they struggled with the concept of abstract ideas in their head, which they soon realized were not real. This realization was a crucial turning point in their life and their interest in philosophy.\n\nThe essay then delves into various topics, including the concept of wisdom and the limitations of knowledge. The author reflects on the famous phrases from Confucius and Aristotle, highlighting the importance of understanding and respecting the \"wisdom\" of others, which the author believes is more important than gaining fame or fortune.\n\nThe author also explores the concept of self-indulgence and how not everyone can be an expert in a particular field due to their upbringing and social conditioning. They use examples such as the artist's block, the difficulty of learning to read, and the artist's reluctance to create music.\n\nThe author also discusses the concept of \"paradigms,\" which refers to the unwritten rules of society that can be confusing and lead to mistakes, and how they can also shape people's perceptions of reality. They share a personal anecdote about a narrator who believed that the world was boring, and how the narrator is still mistaken about the concept of good taste.\n\nThe author argues that if one understands the nuances of human behavior, it's easier to make good decisions, but if one is too eager to act on their assumptions, they risk making mistakes. The author also discusses the importance of humility and not assuming that people will always know what is good or bad, as it can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe author presents various techniques for distinguishing between good and bad writing, such as using a regular expression, learning to produce, and producing a good job, and being aware of one's mistakes and wanting to improve. They share various examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points.\n\nThroughout the essay, the author highlights the importance of being honest about what you like and not pretending to like something you don't. They also discuss the importance of taking a break from work to pursue other interests, and the need to stay focused on a specific goal.\n\nThe author reflects on their own life and how they failed to understand philosophy, which led to a lack of knowledge and success.
