This requires a small, welcoming, and inclusive community with a strong culture of collaboration and innovation. With the right people, a university or college campus can become a hub for startups, where students and entrepreneurs can learn, grow, and experiment without the pressures of a large company. This requires a strategic location, the right infrastructure, and the right mindset. For now, startups thrive in cities with a strong university presence, but not in cities with big, sprawling suburbs that might deter entrepreneurs from trying to start a company. The key is to find a place where you can focus on the work, without being bogged down by bureaucracy and other inefficiencies."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 7.028193712234497, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:52:28+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_1000"}
