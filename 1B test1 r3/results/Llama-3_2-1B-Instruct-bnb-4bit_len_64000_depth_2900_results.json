That means they will take over your life, and if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time. The best advice is to not start a startup at all if you're only 20 and haven't had time to figure out what you want to do.\n\nAdvice 1:\nDo what you love, not what you want to do.\n\nThis means try to identify what you're passionate about and pursue that. This doesn't mean you have to be in love with it.\n\nThis can be broken down into a simple 4 step process:\n\n1. Know yourself, know what you're passionate about, and set aside time to explore it.\n2. Take a course or read books about that topic, or watch documentaries, or talk to people who are already experts.\n3. Try to find people who have expertise in that area, and try to collaborate or learn from them.\n4. Focus on building a network of people who have expertise and can help you achieve your goal of doing what you love.\n\nAdvice 2:\nConsider using a different approach to get out of a difficult place.\n\nIf you're stuck on a problem or task, try to change it without changing your goals or values.\n\nFor example, you might say to yourself, \"I really want to be a successful programmer, but I'm not sure what that means.\" Then you could try to brainstorm ideas for how to get to where you want to be as a programmer.\n\nAdvice 3:\nBe aware of the \"paradigm\" we live in, and how it influences our thoughts.\n\nThe idea that there's a standard or ideal of what a good job or career should be is a paradigm that we live in. Most people are trying to fit into that standard, which can lead to complacency and stagnation.\n\nTo escape that standard, you have to challenge it and think outside of the box. This means being willing to take calculated risks, try new approaches, and learn from your failures.\n\nAdvice 4:\nFocus on the process, not the outcome.\n\nRather than focusing on whether your idea is \"good\" or not, focus on doing it well and consistently producing quality work.\n\nTo do that, try to minimize distractions and interruptions, and focus on the actual work, not just the presentation.\n\nAdvice 5:\nDon't start a startup at 20, if you're not sure what you want to do.\n\nMost people start their careers"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.204155683517456, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:57:26+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_2900"}
