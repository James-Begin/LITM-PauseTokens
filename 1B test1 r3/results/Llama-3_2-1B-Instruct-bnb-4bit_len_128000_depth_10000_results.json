Here are some of the most counterintuitive insights I learned:\n\n**Viaweb (my startup back in 1995)**\n\n* The startup ecosystem is full of nonsense and hype, and we had to fight to get anything serious from the VC community.\n* We had to outsmart the investors by being part of a larger, more established network.\n* The most important quality for a startup founder is not intelligence, but determination.\n* You need to keep repeating what you want to do, rather than stopping to look back.\n* You need to find users for your startup, whether it's by making something unique or unusual.\n\n**Y Combinator (YC)**\n\n* The problem with YC is that it's not a VC, but a platform for startups.\n* The best startups are those that are organic, not just the ones that are \"founder-only\".\n* You need to avoid using pre-existing companies as a model for your startup.\n* Be prepared to take risks and have an open-minded approach to innovation.\n* The startup ecosystem is not just about providing capital, but also about providing advice and support.\n\n**Lisp**\n\n* Lisp is a powerful language that allows you to write programs that are more efficient and powerful than languages that do not have this quality.\n* It's not just about the syntax, but about the way you think about the problem and how you solve it.\n* Lisp is a good language for hackers who want to write throwaway programs.\n* The best languages are those that are good at writing libraries, not just programs.\n\n**Speed**\n\n* Speed is not just about the efficiency of your code, but also about the efficiency of your design.\n* It's about being able to anticipate and solve problems efficiently.\n* You need to have a good compiler, a good interpreter, and a good system for managing memory.\n\n**Time**\n\n* Time is a precious resource that startups should use efficiently.\n* You need to wait for problems to be solved before trying new things.\n* You should be able to tell when someone else has thought of a problem, and when you've solved it.\n\n**Brevity**\n\n* Brevity is essential for startups, as they need to write code quickly and efficiently.\n* You need to keep your code organized and focused, not just in terms of syntax, but also in terms of"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.041908979415894, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:13:35+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_10000"}
