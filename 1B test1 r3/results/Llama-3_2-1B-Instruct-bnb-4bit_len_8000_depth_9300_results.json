Here's a suggestion:\n\nPerhaps the best thing to do is engage in a constructive dialogue about what Aristotle meant by \"metaphysics\" and how it relates to the search for general truths. Explore various philosophical texts and ideas, and try to identify the most general principles that Aristotle aimed to understand. Focus on the idea of applying utility as a criterion to guide the approach, as proposed by Wittgenstein. This could involve writing about controlled experiments, analyzing the concepts, and looking for imprecise definitions that can lead to practical applications."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 5.475050926208496, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:50:59+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_9300"}
