Startups like Google and AirBnB, where the founders are like a tribe that thrives in groups of 8-20 people.\n\nKeep in mind that working for a big company can be challenging, especially if you're a programmer. A good designer will have freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the company.\n\nWhen you're designing a new language, focus on the user, not just what they want. Think about what the user needs, not just what they want.\n\nIn the development process, avoid making new ideas based solely on what users say they want. Focus on what they need.\n\nDesigning for the user is about understanding their needs, not imposing your own desires on them. This means designing what they will be using the software, not what they tell you.\n\nWhen you're designing for human users, consider the context of the project and the intended users. Think about what they're likely to need in a problem you're solving.\n\nYou can use case studies like the example of the iPhone and Adobe to show that good design is not necessarily about creating an \"improved\" version of what's already out there, but rather what will be used to solve a problem that the user needs.\n\nIn programming languages, it's not just about creating an abstract concept, but also about developing a new system that's tailored to the needs of its users."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.245015621185303, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:01:59+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_16000_depth_7400"}
