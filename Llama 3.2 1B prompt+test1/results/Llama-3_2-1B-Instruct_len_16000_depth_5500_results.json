Focus on what the users need, not just what the customers want, and be willing to make sacrifices to do so. Designing for the user, but design what they need, is crucial. Consider your target users and try to design something that addresses their needs, but may not be the most advanced or innovative.\n\nThe best programming language for any situation would be one that solves problems efficiently and allows for easy maintenance and customization. Focus on creating a good design process that is effective in solving problems and providing a positive user experience, rather than just aiming for a new or fashionable language.\n\nDon't just consider your target users, but the people you'll hire to work on the project. Hiring individuals who have a passion for programming, imagination, and innovation will make a bigger impact than hiring someone who just wants the job for the salary or benefits."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 13.334081649780273, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:01:26+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_16000_depth_5500"}
