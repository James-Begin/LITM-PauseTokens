I'll provide my answer in a way that follows the requested structure and is as clear as possible.\n\nWhat is the best way to start a startup?\n\nTo start a startup, you have to like it. I've found that when I'm thinking about my ideas, I have to genuinely enjoy what I do. It's not just about enjoying the end result, but also about understanding the journey. Many successful founders have started with something similar to what they're now doing.\n\nTo figure out what you're addicted to, I suggest trying out your interests. Do you like books? I do. I've found that I get lost in books, and it's hard to find time to do other things. So, if you're a reader, you're probably not like most people who don't read as much as they should.\n\nI also want to encourage people to think about what they want to do. Ask yourself questions, like \"Do you want to want what you want?\" or \"Do you want to do what you want?\" This can help you get into your work without the pressure of expectations.\n\nStart small and experiment with different things. Don't worry too much about what others think. Focus on understanding the problem you're trying to solve, and then you'll be doing what you want.\n\nIn fact, some experts in other fields are surprisingly good at doing what they want. I want to emphasize that there's no such thing as \"good taste\" or \"bad taste.\" There's a narrow sense of taste in art that refers to aesthetic judgments, and a broader sense of taste in literature that refers to preferences of any kind.\n\nIt's hard to get good taste if you're in a place where you're not used to it. But you can still learn to appreciate the work of artists and writers by paying attention to what they do, not what they say.\n\nIf you're an artist, you don't have to be famous to make art. If you're a writer, you don't have to be a published author to be able to write.\n\nIt's often hard to get good grades in school if you're not interested in the subject. It's like going to school without studying. You might not want to do well, but that's okay. What matters is what you want to do.\n\nMany famous people are not good at everything they do.
