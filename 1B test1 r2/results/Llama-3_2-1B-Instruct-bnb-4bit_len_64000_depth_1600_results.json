The author argues that, despite popular conceptions of wisdom and intelligence, most people fail to appreciate what they like, as they often focus on prestige and financial gain. The author identifies several common pitfalls that people often fall into, including: \n\n1. Being too focused on prestige: many people who claim to have genius-level intelligence are often motivated by the wrong reasons and end up doing work that they don't want to do because of the desire for prestige.\n\n2. Ignoring opinions and beliefs that aren't well-supported: people often only consider opinions they already hold, which makes them resistant to new ideas.\n\n3. Being self-indulgent and dismissive of other people's opinions: people who refuse to think outside the box and consider alternative perspectives often fail to appreciate the merits of alternative ideas.\n\n4. Being overly critical and disheartened: many people get discouraged by the lack of recognition or success, which motivates them to do more of the same.\n\n5. Lack of critical thinking and humility: people often fail to question their assumptions and accept new ideas out of fear of appearing foolish.\n\nThe author also argues that knowledge and wisdom are often correlated, but not equal. While wisdom is knowing what to do in a situation, knowledge is knowing what not to do. The author argues that there is a trade-off between wisdom and knowledge, and that those who are not knowledgeable about a particular topic may be good at solving that problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author argues that, while people may claim to be intelligent and wise, many of them fail to appreciate what they like due to a combination of factors, including being too focused on prestige, ignoring opinions, being self-indulgent, being critical, and lacking critical thinking and humility.\n\nSome notable points mentioned in the essay include:\n\n- The concept of \"good taste\" is often confused with being able to appreciate good art, but it is actually related to knowing what to do in a situation.\n- The author points out that the study of classics is often taught in schools, but this is not a good reason to ignore it, as it is actually a valuable field that can teach important lessons.\n- The author argues that the modern concept of education has mixed up the teaching of writing with the study of literature.\n- The author suggests that the teaching of English is often focused on teaching literature, rather than teaching writing.\n- The author argues that the author was initially unsympath"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.179692268371582, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:32:53+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1600"}
