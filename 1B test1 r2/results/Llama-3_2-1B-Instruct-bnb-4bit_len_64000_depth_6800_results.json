The author, whose name is not mentioned in the essay, starts his story in the 1990s, as part of a project called Viaweb, a web-based software tool. He initially wrote the software in Lisp, a high-level language, to build online stores. The author mentions that the first versions of Lisp were limited, lacking the ability to run on servers, unlike C, which was used in early Web development.\n\nThe author explains that he and his co-founder Robert Morris knew that good programming languages were not just about mastering them, but about understanding the underlying concepts and principles, not just executing them. The author compares programming languages to a secret weapon in a business, and notes that most people underestimate the effort required to make their work successful.\n\nThe author shares his thoughts on the nature of good taste and what it means to have great taste, citing the fact that even people with a different background in their childhood do not become successful in their careers. The author notes that, as a child, he would rather explore unknown things than follow the status quo. He explains that good taste is not just about aesthetic judgements, but about the depth of understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe author discusses the differences between real essays and what they teach in schools. He notes that students are taught to write about their favorite books, authors, and topics without considering the depth of understanding or the potential readership. He argues that most people are not interested in classical literature, and that the teaching of literature in schools is largely about showcasing the \"art\" rather than educating students.\n\nThe author then delves into the world of computer science and writing, comparing the language of artificial intelligence to music and chess. He notes that, like most experts, he has an advantage in discovering new ideas, as he was often given access to technology that others did not, even at his own age.\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of creativity, humility, and discipline in achieving success. He shares some of his own experiences with self-discovery, including a decision to pursue a career in business and academia, which often involved taking risks and challenging conventional wisdom.\n\nThe author also touches on the concept of 'paradigms' and how it can lead people astray, including the idea that the concept of 'good' art is subjective and not objective. He notes that, if artists"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.19794988632202, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:36:01+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_6800"}
