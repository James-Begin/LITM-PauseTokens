You need a town or city with both rich people and nerds. \n\nInstead, I propose that you start a startup by creating a university or high school. Not only do you attract rich people and nerds, but also have an intact center where the founders can gather and work together to solve problems.\n\nThis is the 4th counterintuitive point, and it's the key to making a startup hub. The key is to have enough people, especially nerds, to attract the right people and create a good atmosphere. A university or high school is an ideal place to start, as it already has a large number of students and faculty, and you can establish a strong bond with them by offering programs and resources specifically for startups.\n\nAdditionally, you can use chance meetings with people who can help you, and also hire people with good connections who can provide advice and guidance.\n\nThe final answer is: A university or high school with a strong community of rich people and nerds can help create a successful startup hub."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.2146897315979, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:30:38+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_5500"}
