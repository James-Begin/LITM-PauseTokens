For example, when exploring evolutionary biology, starting with something like \"the control of burritos\" could lead to new, useful ideas.\n\nThe author suggests that, just like math, the goal is to find precise and accurate descriptions, and that metaphysics should be like math, where a simple statement can have a wide application.\n\nThe text also highlights that the problem of the \"philosophy problem\" is not to prove or disprove anything, but to discover useful and general truths."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 6.107379198074341, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:26:24+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_2300"}
