If you work on something not just to make money, but because you want to make it better, you'll eventually attract customers and gain a market for your product.  That's the idea behind Y Combinator, a program that helps early-stage startups like Yaw, the company I started out of back in 1995.  It provides funding, resources, and expertise to help founders like me improve our products and reach customers.  The goal is to help startups like Yaw grow fast enough to make a profit.\n\nBy using Y Combinator's platform, we were able to release early, which means we only released a minimal version of our software.  This helped us improve our product and attract customers before we had to improve it further.  We also worked on a web app that let users edit code online, which was an innovative solution to a common problem.  We didn't know how to do it, but Robert Blackwell, who was a close friend of mine, was the first to figure it out and teach us.\n\nBy doing something for something, we attracted customers and gained a market for our product.  We also created a logo for the web app and started making money from it.  We didn't know how much money we would make, but we knew that we were doing something that would help the community.\n\nWe also built an online store that would let users order web apps.  We didn't have any users at the time, but we got a bunch of users from the internet, and eventually, we started selling our app.  It was a slow start, but we kept working on it and eventually gained more users.\n\nOur first product was a web app that allowed users to create their own online stores.  We didn't know how to build it, but Robert and I figured out how to do it.  We called it an \"application service provider.\"  We were like a business, but we weren't a traditional business.  We were working on something for other people, but we were working on it because we wanted to make it better.\n\nWe also realized that we needed to improve our marketing, not just our product.  So, we created a blog that would talk about our progress and encourage our users to help us improve the product.  We also made a YouTube video that would explain the basics of how our app worked.  We were very careful to tailor our marketing to our audience, so"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.11621141433716, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:51:21+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_8000"}
