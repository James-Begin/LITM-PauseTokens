Start small: Begin with a small, established university or a tech hub, like New York, Boulder, or Portland, which offer a good balance of personality and affordability.\n2.  Avoid large, established companies: Steer clear of well-known companies like Google, Microsoft, or Apple, which often have large, structured work environments that might suffocate your team's freedom.\n3.  Find a niche with a strong startup ecosystem: Look for a city with a small, established startup community, such as Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has a thriving tech scene with a strong focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n4.  Be open to adaptability: Be prepared to grow and adapt quickly, as the startup landscape can be unpredictable, and changes can quickly shift the balance of power.\n5.  Focus on a niche within your industry: Target a specific area within your industry, such as AI, cybersecurity, or sustainable energy, to differentiate yourself and tap into a dedicated audience.\n6.  Invest in infrastructure: Focus on creating a high-quality, high-speed, and reliable infrastructure, including a professional team, to help your startup grow sustainably.\n\nConsidering the suggestions above, the best starting point for a Silicon Valley-like ecosystem in San Francisco would be to start a small, niche company with a strong startup ecosystem, like Boulder or New York, rather than a large, established tech hub like San Francisco."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 11.545329809188843, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:27:34+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_16000_depth_1600"}
