The author started by questioning the conventional wisdom about these concepts, which he believes is misguided. He argues that the distinction between wisdom and intelligence is not just about knowing how to solve problems, but also about knowing what to do. \n\nThe author recalls his own struggles in trying to decide what he wants to do when he was a teenager, highlighting the contrast between how he felt of doing \"bad\" things, like playing basketball and watching violent movies, versus doing something as pleasurable and fulfilling. He argues that most people make mistakes in identifying what they want to do because they lack self-awareness and are influenced by others who want them to take risks.\n\nThe author proposes a framework to distinguish between the organic route and the two-job route to follow when deciding what to do. The organic route involves taking an idea and running with it without knowing what you want to do. The two-job route is more common and involves having a stable job with more freedom, but it requires being aware of your biases and constraints. The author argues that it's often hard to change one's perspective and that the best approach is to be honest with oneself.\n\nThe author reflects on his own struggles with his passion for writing, which was initially dismissed by his friends as \"a hobby\". He argues that true talent in writing comes from understanding the best way to convey ideas, not just being able to express oneself. The author provides examples of famous writers who did not achieve success due to their passion and preferences.\n\nHe introduces the concept of the \"wisdom paradox\" which questions the existence of \"good\" and \"bad\" things. He suggests that it's easy to talk about art and other abstract concepts without actually engaging with them deeply, as most people don't actually read the work. He argues that the concept of good taste is not something that exists, but is often used to demoralize people.\n\nThe author also discusses the concept of a \"writing major\" in universities, which he argues is not only not a well-thought-out academic discipline, but also often used to suppress creativity and innovation. The author reflects on the idea of teaching good writing to students and how it's often a poor imitation of real writing."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 19.805477619171143, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:35:37+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_6100"}
