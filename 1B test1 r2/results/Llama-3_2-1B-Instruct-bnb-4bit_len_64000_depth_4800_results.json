They describe how they used to work with only a small team and write code in Lisp, a programming language that is at the intersection of machine language and high-level languages.\n\nThe author highlights the challenges of defining a startup, particularly in a competitive industry like technology. They discuss the concept of good taste and how it relates to writing. The author also addresses the issue of writing styles and explains that they have four types of writing styles: the \"I'm writing this essay\", \"I just write this\", \"I've been trying to write this\", and \"I never read books\". They claim that most people are more inclined to write the first two, \"I'm writing this\" and \"I just write this\", rather than \"I've been trying to write this\".\n\nThe author explains that they have learned to write in a way that is different from what they were taught in school. They share their own experiences of writing and argue that good writing is not about style but about content.\n\nThe author highlights the importance of creating a unique product or service and having a unique selling proposition (USP). They argue that the concept of good taste is not about liking something over others, but about understanding its underlying value.\n\nThe author provides some examples of writing styles, including the famous \"I love this\" and \"I'm not a fan of this\". They argue that most people are more inclined to write \"I'm not a fan of this\" rather than \"I love this\".\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the importance of being true to oneself and doing what one wants, not what one is supposed to do."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.05033850669861, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:34:50+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
