Instead, startups are often influenced by the market and the people in it. The author suggests that most startups fail because they are trying to compete with each other rather than understanding the needs of their customers.\n\nThe author then delves into the topic of \"Wisdom\" vs \"Intelligence\" and explores the distinction between the two. It argues that wisdom is about knowing what to do in a particular situation, while intelligence is about knowing how to solve problems. The author claims that most people's taste in ideas is influenced by the prevailing paradigm, a concept that is often overlooked.\n\nThe author goes on to explain how it's hard to distinguish between new ideas and established ones, and how most startups fail because they fail to understand the market. The author suggests that it's essential to start with a concept and build a system around it, rather than trying to solve a problem.\n\nThe article also touches on the topic of expertise, which the author believes is not enough on its own. The author argues that most people are happy to work on problems they enjoy, but are less happy to work on problems they don't enjoy. This leads the author to propose a new definition of success as doing what you love.\n\nThe author also discusses the idea of \"not everyone can do what you want,\" and how it's easy to get stuck in a cycle of dissatisfaction. The author suggests that it's essential to break this cycle by doing what you love, but without actually doing it.\n\nThe article ends with an excerpt from the work of Donald Hall, where he suggests that students can avoid making mistakes by thinking about the problem in a different way. The author proposes a list of things that people should not do when starting their careers, which includes being a cog, following trends, and not being willing to take risks.\n\nThe author also explores the topic of the \"Age of the Essay,\" which suggests that most essays are written poorly, lacking a clear structure and lacking clarity. The author proposes that the best approach to writing an essay is to rewrite it, rather than sticking with the original approach.\n\nFinally, the author discusses the idea that some people are naturally talented at some subjects, while others are not. The author argues that even if one knows their area of expertise well, they will not necessarily be successful in it, and"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.18837332725525, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:34:05+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_3500"}
