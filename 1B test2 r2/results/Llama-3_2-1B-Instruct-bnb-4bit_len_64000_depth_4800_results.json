It defines wisdom as knowing what to do in most situations, whereas intelligence is acquired by a combination of curiosity and expertise. The author argues that startups often fail to capitalize on their true potential due to their inability to handle uncertainty and failure, particularly in their early stages. \n\nThe essay emphasizes that wisdom is not something you acquire after being \"in\" a particular profession, but rather as a fundamental aspect of your life, whereas intelligence can be easily acquired with practice. It cites examples such as the example of Viaweb, a startup developed by the author and Robert Morris, to show that even a small, seemingly insignificant, step can be significant in achieving success. The author argues that the initial steps of starting a startup, such as setting up a server and developing the core product, are not the only challenges but also the key to success.\n\nThe essay also touches on the importance of taking calculated risks, such as investing too much in a startup without taking on enough risk, and the importance of not using big companies' terminology and concepts, which are often used by VCs. The author explains that most people's taste is skewed towards things that are fashionable, but not necessarily better, and that it's better to focus on finding your own niche and doing things that you enjoy, rather than trying to fit in with the mainstream.\n\nThe essay concludes that it's not just the big, loud talk of being part of the \"industry\" that can drive you crazy, but also the mindset of people in the industry. The author notes that most startups do not get the funding they deserve because of their focus on prestige, and that VCs often overlook the best startups when they invest in them.\n\nIn addition, the author explores the concept of \"not everyone can do\" things, which refers to the ability to take risks, adapt to changing circumstances, and learn from experiences. It also touches on the idea that the most successful people are not the ones who are most brilliant but rather those who are most adaptable and resilient. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of taking risks, being open to new ideas, and being willing to take calculated risks to achieve success.\n\nThe author also mentions that some people have a more pronounced advantage when it comes to discovering new ideas, and provides a hypothetical example of how one might discover something they know they love. The author defines \"taste\" as the ability to distinguish"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.226341485977173, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:28:14+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
