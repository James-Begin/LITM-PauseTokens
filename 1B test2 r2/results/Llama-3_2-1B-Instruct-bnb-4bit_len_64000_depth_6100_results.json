Most people are supposed to say what you do in a meeting, not what you want to do.  Most people do that when they're not confident, not when they are.\n\nThere are many other situations in life where you could be doing something you'd rather do, but are stuck working on something that you don't enjoy.\n\nA friend was going to start a career in law, but was going to leave behind his family because it was so boring.\n\nThe ideal job seems the hardest to find when you don't know what to do.\n\nTo discover the thing you want to do, it's better to do something else first.\n\nIf you try to think of an idea for something you want to do, you might need to see how many other people have done it before to figure out if it's better to do it or not.\n\nYou don't have to get paid to do things you don't want to do, so you might need to work for a company that pays less.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out what you want to do if you know a bit about it.  For example, you might know that if you become a doctor, but still have to study for a long time.\n\nIt's a good rule to ask yourself what you want to do before trying to do it.\n\nIt's not true that you have to like what you do, but what you do often must be something that you do that you like.  For example, if you're a programmer, your favorite part of your job might not be writing code.\n\nIf you're looking for work, you can find work you like, even if you can't always figure out what that is.\n\nIt's better to have a regular job than to be unemployed, because the former will give you some freedom and some security.\n\nA person who knows a lot about what they want to do will probably be able to do that job, because the former has been established for a long time.\n\nWriting is one of the hardest things you can do that you don't enjoy, but it's better than not doing it.\n\nDoing something you don't enjoy is just a waste of time, because there's always a better way to do it.\n\nThe worst things you do in life are things you'd rather not do, because they're not fun.\n\nDoing things that you love is the only way to make them happen, because you can't force something to happen if you don't want"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.240814447402954, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:29:03+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_6100"}
