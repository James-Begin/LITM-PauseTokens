People are often more motivated by their own curiosity and the sense of excitement around new ideas than by a desire for financial reward or recognition.\n\nFor example, Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, started his company by thinking about what he wanted to do, not just what others thought he could do. He was so interested in the idea of space exploration that he built a rocket to take himself and a few friends on a trip around the world. \n\nSimilarly, when Mark Zuckerberg went back to college to continue his work on Facebook, he had to be willing to take risks and put in extra time to achieve his goal. His friends were not only skeptical but also impressed by his dedication.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the initial seed of an idea can be enough to start a startup, rather than a large number of people having to work together. \n\nAdditionally, startups often require a specific mindset, such as a willingness to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas.\n\nUltimately, finding the right balance between financial success, personal fulfillment, and societal impact is crucial for achieving success in a startup."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 10.047884464263916, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:25:43+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_10000"}
