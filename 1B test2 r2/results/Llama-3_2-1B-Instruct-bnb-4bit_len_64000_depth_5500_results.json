The author argues that there are different approaches to understanding how to make a startup successful, with two primary methods: starting with an idea and waiting for it to gain traction, and starting with an existing startup and gaining traction quickly.\n\nThe article then delves into the world of venture capital and the rise of super-angels and VCs, who are investing more and more into startups. The author suggests that these new investors are driving startups to prioritize their interests over that of the startups themselves, which has raised the stakes and made the market more competitive.\n\nThe author explores the world of programming languages and how some of the most powerful ones are often ignored in favor of the less powerful ones. They use Lisp as a case study, highlighting its ease of use and flexibility, making it well-suited for rapid development and problem-solving.\n\nThe article also touches on the concept of \"wisdom\" again, emphasizing the importance of understanding and embracing one's passions, and not allowing others to dictate one's path.
