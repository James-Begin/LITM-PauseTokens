The field of philosophy is young, still reeling from the unexpected breakdown of words.\n\nA suggested approach is to aim for something more general, like \"what are the most general truths?\" rather than trying to prove or disprove something. This might involve exploring new concepts, making observations that might seem imprecise, but lead to useful results.\n\nIn essence, philosophy's \"big generalizations\" are a result of its imprecise nature, making it difficult to achieve absolute truth. However, starting with useful and general ideas can help people understand these concepts better.\n\nThe passage also touches on the idea of dependence on Aristotle's contributions in Western culture and the meaning of the word \"philosophy\" has evolved over time. Aristotle's work laid the foundation for Western philosophy, including science and \"metaphysics,\" which included \"first philosophy.\"\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that not all philosophers up to the present day have used their ideas for practical purposes. Some have preferred to use them for the sake of persuasion or to fit in with their audiences."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.836436986923218, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:19:14+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_4800"}
