The author argues that philosophy has been used to explain things that are not worth explaining and that many people have wasted their time studying this field.\n\nThe author mentions various philosophers, including Aristotle, Plato, and Kant, and notes that their works had a profound impact on Western philosophy, but also reveal some of its flaws. They point out that even modern philosophers have been influenced by Aristotle's ideas, which were later rejected, and that the idea of \"metaphysics\" (the study of abstract concepts) was initially called \"first philosophy\" by Aristotle.\n\nThe author suggests that a more practical approach to philosophy, focusing on the \"what\" of philosophy, rather than its \"what if,\" could be more effective. They propose a new approach that starts with the concept and gradually moves to the generalization, as Aristotle's work did, to explore the most general truths.\n\nThe author also critiques the emphasis on precision and abstraction in philosophy, which can lead to \"axe the axe\" or \"nonsense\" when it comes to explanations that appeal to the weak or those who don't care."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.261854410171509, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:19:02+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_4200"}
