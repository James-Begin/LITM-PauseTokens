But you need to prove to yourself that you're good at something by doing it.  That's why you need to start with something you love and work hard to make it great, not just because you're smart, but because it's challenging.  If you're too focused on making money, or trying to win prestige, you might miss out on amazing opportunities.\n\nA very good piece of advice, which has changed my mind, is to \"do what you love\" - to try things you don't want to do, and even when you're uncertain.  In my case, my career was more of a mixture of both.  I used to write programs in simple languages like C and even later on, in higher-order languages like Python, Lisp, and Haskell.  My work was all about the programming concepts, not just the code.  We used a lot of Lisp in our system, and it was a game-changer.  I remember writing a Lisp program that could automate a lot of tasks, which saved us a lot of time.\n\nIf you know you're smart, then you have a great advantage.  In fact, most programmers who are very good at math will also be smart, and most math problems can be solved using higher-order functions, but the important thing is not knowing it, but being willing to learn it.  When I was at Harvard, I saw a lot of other students trying to write programs for popular languages like C and Perl.  While I was studying computer science, I was trying to solve math problems in those languages.  And when I finally mastered it, I realized that most other people were still struggling with the basics.\n\nThere are two routes to solving problems.  One is the \"organic\" route, where you work on the problem and try to make it your own, without any external influence.  The other is the \"two-job\" route, where you take an outside job and use that as a stepping stone to start your own.  The two-job route is more common among early-stage founders, but it's also harder and less reliable.\n\nMost people make mistakes in the two-job route because they don't want to be taken advantage of by their employers or colleagues"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.25760531425476, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:31:06+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_9300"}
