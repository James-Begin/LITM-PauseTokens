The truth is, I started a startup called Viaweb in 1995 while attending college, not because I thought of Viaweb, but because I was fascinated by the concept of software that could run on the web. We used a programming language called Lisp, which was not yet widely used in universities and research labs, so we started with the basics of programming. I remember being amazed at how quickly and easily we could build software. We had no experience in business, but we knew the concept of a user-friendly interface for websites.\n\nWe took a chance on something new, and it paid off. We went from having 5,000 users to 70,000, 500, and eventually, 1070 users, without taking the conventional startup route. I believe that a great startup founder must be able to make a genuine leap, not just innovate, and that's what we called the Blub paradox.\n\nFor me, the best thing to do is to follow a recipe that I know works. The key is to follow the process of finding something you're passionate about and doing it well.\n\nAs someone who was ambitious and determined to succeed, I realized that my best chance of success came from avoiding mistakes, not creating them. The best command is the ability to always produce.\n\nI once realized that in the beginning of my career, I would often get lost in the details of a project, so I would start with a big idea, then focus on the implementation. I now focus on a specific, specific objective, and see what the process is.\n\nWhile working on Viaweb, I used to make things that were easy to do but not the best. It was a mistake. I learned to work harder, ask myself what I liked to do and why, and it helped me to make more informed decisions about which paths to take.\n\nThe organic route: do what you love; don't work until you're willing to work harder. The two-job route: try to get the work you don't like, but be willing to work longer hours. It's a mix of both routes that has worked for me, as long as you know what you want to do.\n\nAvoiding mistakes by asking yourself, \"Do I want this?\" rather than \"Can I make it work?\" can be a"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.260825634002686, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:31:30+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_10000"}
