Founders often have to convince VCs to help them by making complex decisions and convincing them to take risks, which is often a barrier to raising money.\n\nTo determine the best route for a startup, it's necessary to know what the founders have expertise in.

However, it's also essential to be mindful of the potential risks and consequences of choosing a lower-demand path.\n\nYou may benefit from seeking advice from domain experts, even if you're not aware of it, as this can help you gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This is not to say that one should make bold decisions, but rather that they should actively engage with the world of work and learn from it.\n\nThe value of a product is not always tied to the multiple the company gets; it can also be tied to a well-executed strategy, careful planning, and effective execution.
