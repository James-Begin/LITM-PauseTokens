Here's my response:\n\nThe writer's essay \"How to Become a Hacker\" by Eric Raymond starts with the author's thoughts on why he chose to start a startup, Viaweb in 1995. The author was initially interested in exploring new technologies, but later shifted their focus to writing end-user applications running on the Web. The author mentions that they chose the name \"Viaweb\" because the software worked via the Web, not because it was running on their desktop computer. The author's plan was to write software that would help end-users build online stores, but they later decided to focus on writing a server-based application using Lisp, a high-level programming language.\n\nThe writer also mentions that the lack of familiarity with computers made them doubt their initial idea, but they later proved that their idea was valuable. They mention that they had no experience in business, which turned out to be a mistake. Instead of taking on other jobs to make a living, the writer focused on finding a way to get paid for work they wanted to do. They eventually created Viaweb, which was written primarily in Lisp, a language they learned to be useful.\n\nThe writer then explains the concept of \"good taste\" and how most people lack it, which they had realized by the time they started their work. They mention that most people think artists are not good at their jobs, which is a myth, and that they are actually more talented. The writer also explains the concept of \"good taste\" as a way of describing what art looks like, which is subjective and varies from person to person.\n\nThe writer also discusses the concept of \"better\" and \"worse\" taste, as people tend to agree on which art is good, but disagree on which artist's work is better. They mention that most artists are not paid for their work and that artists often struggle to get paid for their work. The writer suggests that most people lack good taste, which is a necessary condition for creating art. They discuss the problem of plagiarism, which occurs when people claim to have original ideas, and how it happens in various fields, including science.\n\nThe writer also discusses the importance of creativity and originality, and how most people lack the latter. They mention that even successful people often lack the former, as demonstrated by Einstein, Bellini, and the author's own experiences. They also discuss the importance of seeking inspiration and the"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.22936224937439, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:27:50+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4200"}
