To achieve the goal of discovering the most general truths, as proposed by Aristotle, without relying on the imprecise aspects of human language, we can try to do so by exploring and analyzing the most general observations, as suggested by the philosopher Joseph Stigler. This approach involves starting with specific, useful, and general ideas, and gradually making them more general.\n2. One potential path to philosophical inquiry is to begin with a broad, useful, and tentative observation, as Wittgenstein might have suggested, and then gradually refine it by adding more precision and specificity.\n3. Aristotle's concept of \"metaphysics\" was originally about discovering the most general truths, which involved understanding and exploring the underlying concepts and principles. While not all of his work is preserved, Aristotle's legacy continues to be relevant today, as evident in various fields such as logic, science, and philosophy.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that these paths may not be practical or effective for all individuals, as stated by the philosopher Plato: \"Most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their time.\""}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.361780166625977, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:20:23+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_9300"}
