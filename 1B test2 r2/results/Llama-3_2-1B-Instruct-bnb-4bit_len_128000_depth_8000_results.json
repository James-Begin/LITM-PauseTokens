However, most programmers are paid by other programmers, who are usually not experts in the field. For instance, the author of a piece of code is paid by someone else to use the code they've created, not the creators of the code.\n\nNow, let's talk about the concept of \"doing things that don't scale.\" A throwaway program is a program that someone writes for a limited task, like a small project or a side hustle, but does not have the potential to be used by many people. These programs are not typically designed to be the language of choice for bigger systems.\n\nA throwaway program is a program that someone writes in a language that they don't expect to be used by many people. For example, someone who writes a game in Lisp, a scripting language, may write a small game that they don't expect to be used by anyone else.\n\nNow, let's talk about \"brevity.\" Brevity is the shortest number of characters in a piece of code. Hackers are often lazy, and they hate anything extraneous in their code.\n\nTo be good, a programming language should be easy to read, write, and understand. This is because it is not just about writing code for computers; it's about writing code for humans.\n\nA good programming language should have features like brevity, such as the ability to declare variables quickly, to have a small core of well-understood and highly orthogonal operators, and to be able to provide quick and easy access to internal data structures.\n\nA good programming language should also be good for writing throwaway programs. This means that it should be able to handle common tasks with ease, such as automating tasks or generating test data.\n\nFinally, a good programming language should have library functions that are as carefree as possible, such as libraries that can be called directly without having to use explicit calls.\n\nIn conclusion, a programming language should be able to appeal to a wide range of users, including hackers. It should be able to handle brevity, have good library functions, and be easy to write and understand.\n\nHere are some additional notes on the concepts mentioned above.\n\n* Brevity: A good"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.076284885406494, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:41:09+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_8000"}
