Instead, focus on what you want to do, not what others will think. Doing great work takes less discipline than people think. \n\nThe most important rule to follow is the one about \"Do what you love.\" Many experts like to tell that one should do something, but not love it, just to avoid the trap of trying to be a writer, philosopher, or mathematician. \n\nWhile people may not have to worry about prestige or wealth, it's easy to get distracted and lose focus when the stakes are high. However, having the freedom to create your own projects and pursue them can be incredibly liberating. \n\nIn many areas, including math, engineering, and the arts, creativity and innovation thrive, but not when you're working for others. Most people are driven by the promise of prestige, not passion.\n\nIf you're not familiar with a specific domain, it's harder to grasp its nuances and may not provide any benefit. Even domain experts may not know what you love to do if they're not familiar with your expertise. Therefore, it's essential to do what you love to get started and grow. \n\nIn business, the \"organic route\" might work better, where you focus on what you love to do and don't worry about your career's potential pitfalls. The two-job route, where you can learn new skills and grow without being tied to a specific role, can also work if you're aware of your limitations and not your strengths.\n\nA key aspect of great work is the ability to do what you want, not just want what you do. It's possible to change your preferences over time, but it's harder to do it later. Knowing that you have the best tools, including software like Lisp, can help you navigate challenges, even if it's not widely used.\n\nThe concept of good taste is not absolute, but rather a matter of how you perceive beauty. If art is not subjective and objective, how can we say it exists? People can say something is good, but not necessarily better than someone else's. The distinction between art and commerce is not binary.\n\nArt has the capacity to engage multiple senses, unlike the visual sense of a painting, which is subjective. People's tastes are not fixed, but rather shaped by various factors like culture, society, and even genetics. You can't have good taste without a willingness to change and adapt your preferences.\n\nIt's difficult to"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.25926947593689, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:26:55+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_2300"}
