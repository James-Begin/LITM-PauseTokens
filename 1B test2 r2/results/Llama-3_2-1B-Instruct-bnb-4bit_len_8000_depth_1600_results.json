They suggest starting with the utility of the work and asking, \"What are the most general truths?\" rather than trying to answer a question like, \"What is the most general truths?\" The individual claims that this approach can lead to more valuable and practical results. \n\nThe individual provides evidence from various fields, such as math, science, and even ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, that support the idea that philosophy should start with general observations rather than specific definitions or theories. They also point out that even modern Western philosophy has a long history of overlap between ancient and modern philosophical traditions. \n\nWhile the philosopher acknowledges that some may argue that philosophers should focus on abstract concepts or ideas, they argue that this approach is essential to achieving actual progress in philosophy. They also suggest that many ideas, such as math, have been overhyped and are often reduced to \"incantation\" by scholars, making philosophy like this unnecessary.\n\nUltimately, the philosopher proposes a new approach to philosophy, one that starts with finding the most general truths, rather than trying to achieve more specific or precise results. They argue that this approach could lead to a more valuable and practical field of study, one that is not as dependent on abstract concepts or ideas."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 10.15603494644165, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:18:14+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_1600"}
