They admit to being naive and lacking knowledge in the philosophy department. The speaker notes that philosophers often confuse motive and result, and that it's easy for people to argue about words without reaching any real conclusions. \n\nHowever, the speaker argues that philosophers should aim for general truths rather than specific, useful answers. They propose a new approach to philosophy, which is to focus on finding the most general truths that are useful to others. This involves starting with the idea and gradually making it more general.\n\nThe speaker also discusses the concept of \"metaphysics,\" which Aristotle defined as the study of abstract ideas. They note that modern philosophers seem to be attracted to \"abstract nonsense\" when it's presented in a clever or appealing way. However, the speaker argues that this is not only wasted time, but also unsatisfying.\n\nThey also reflect on the evolution of philosophy, citing the influence of Plato and Aristotle on Western philosophy, as well as the importance of math in understanding abstract concepts. The speaker notes that European culture had a concept of the essence of something before the invention of modern physics, and that modern Western philosophy has retained some of this, albeit with added complexity.\n\nThe speaker also questions the relevance of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, stating that many ideas they discovered were not as general as they seemed, and that his work in logic and zoology was groundbreaking, but not necessary for the field of philosophy.\n\nLastly, the speaker reflects on the influence of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein on Western philosophy, noting that Wittgenstein's mastery of language led to a lack of understanding of abstract concepts."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 13.386230945587158, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 05:18:51+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_3500"}
