Here are the key points from the essay:\n\n1. The author, a software engineer and founder of Viaweb, explains the origins of programming languages and how they were initially developed for Unix and other systems in the 1960s and 1970s. They also discuss the concept of Lisp, which was developed in the 1950s by John McCarthy, and how it laid the foundation for modern programming languages.\n\n2. The author discusses the concept of brevity, brevity being the opposite of complexity, and how programming languages need to have short syntax to be effective.\n\n3. The author argues that brevity is essential for programmers, and that complex code is often a sign of poor design. The author also discusses the concept of syntax, or the way a programming language is used, and how it should be designed to be efficient.\n\n4. The author explains the concept of time-sharing and how it is essential for programmers to understand how their code should be designed to run smoothly.\n\n5. The author discusses the importance of time and the need for programmers to wait until they have had enough time to understand and design their code.\n\n6. The author argues that the best way to design a language is to consider the target user's needs and preferences, rather than to design it for a specific market or audience.\n\n7. The author explains the concept of libraries and how they can be used to extend the functionality of a language.\n\n8. The author discusses the importance of syntax in programming languages, and how it should be designed to be efficient and intuitive.\n\n9. The author argues that the best way to design a language is to consider the needs of the user, and not to design it for a specific market or audience.\n\n10. The author also discusses the importance of brevity, time, and the need for programmers to wait until they have had enough time to understand and design their code.\n\n11. The author concludes that the best way to design a language is to consider the needs of the user, and not to design it for a specific market or audience.\n\n12. The author also mentions that the best way to design a language is to consider the needs of the user, and not to design it for a specific market or audience.\n\n13.
