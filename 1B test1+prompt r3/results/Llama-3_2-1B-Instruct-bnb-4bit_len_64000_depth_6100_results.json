The author notes that wisdom is \"not merely wise talk\" and that it involves knowing what to do in a wide range of situations. The author's experience in writing software for Viaweb, a company he co-founded in 1995, provides insight into the importance of doing what one loves, rather than just what is popular or convenient.\n\nThe author notes that the notion of \"good taste\" in art has been misused in educational settings, where students are taught about ancient texts and classical scholarship without giving them any substance, and people who claim to have good taste often are mistaken about it. The author argues that students should learn to write, but the emphasis on teaching them the \"essays\" and the \"reading of English literature\" has led to the suppression of true writing.\n\nThe author also explores the concept of the \"blue function\" in the sense that people are willing to do whatever is expected of them, including taking orders or going on a job. The author notes that this concept is often seen as a product of a particular economic model that prioritizes growth and productivity over genuine passion and effort.\n\nThe author also discusses the concept of \"paradigms\" and how they can lead to rigidity and dogma in one's thinking. The author argues that a strong argument for the existence of good taste in art is that people would want the art they like if it was good, but not just because of the artist's fame.\n\nThe author notes that the modern concept of \"good taste\" in art and literature is actually a myth, and that most people are not interested in this subject matter. The author argues that if the goal is to get people to love what they do, it is better to teach them about a different subject, such as writing, rather than just emphasizing a specific art form.\n\nThe author also presents various experiments and cases to show that the notion of \"good taste\" in literature is flawed, and that people who claim to have good taste often are not. The author notes that the idea of good taste is not just about enjoying something; it is also about understanding its subject matter, which has not always been the case.\n\nThe author notes that the concept of the \"expert system\" in the 18th century had no basis in fact, as authors did not expect their works to be read as good art. The author argues that this lack of understanding led"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.324910879135132, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:20:20+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_6100"}
