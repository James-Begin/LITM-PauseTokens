The author shares their own experience of working on a startup called Viaweb, where they wrote software that allowed end users to build online stores using a web interface. They explain that Viaweb ran on a server that could run web pages as the interface, rather than a desktop computer. The author shares that they chose Lisp as their programming language, knowing that it was more powerful than machine language and had no syntax, making it hard to use for non-tech people.\n\nThe author argues that programming languages vary in power and explains that even experienced programmers like themselves can have a difficult time with non-programming languages like Perl. However, they also discuss the benefits of using high-level languages, like Lisp, for writing software quickly and efficiently. The author claims that a person should aim to do what they want, but can't want to want what they want.\n\nThe author also discusses the idea of \"wish-ful thinking,\" where people often change what they want to want. They propose the \"wish-ful thinking\" is often incorrect and can be easily expressed using expressions such as \"You can do what you want,\" but not truly do it.\n\nThe author also mentions that the writing tradition in schools has been largely influenced by the study of ancient texts and has been misused to teach students the wrong things about writing. They argue that most people are taught to write essays as a formality and not as a true expression of creative writing.\n\nThe author discusses the importance of understanding the purpose of art, which they argue is not something that can be taught in a linear way, but rather through a combination of creative expression and experimentation. They also discuss the value of using a \"wish-ful thinking\" approach to writing and argues that most people are so focused on the outcome that they often miss the meaning.\n\nThe author presents a checklist to help individuals become better writers, including doing what they want, avoiding \"wish-ful thinking,\" and learning to use expressions that can lead to improvement, such as \"You can do what you want.\"\n\nThe author also mentions a famous quote by E.B. White that states \"good writing is rewriting.\" They argue that most students have a bad time learning to write, as their teachers try to teach the wrong things about writing.\n\nThe author ends the essay by discussing a \"wish-ful thinking\" that occurs when students are trying to get good grades by writing mediocre essays.
