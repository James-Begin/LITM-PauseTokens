Many people who do it hope to raise money from venture capitalists (VCs), and VCs often look for VC money, not VC advice. VCs can be misleading, as they may be interested in getting an immediate return on investment, rather than seeing the true value of the company.\n\nHowever, some VCs have become more like angel investors. They may not take board seats, instead choosing a founder-only board. To mitigate the risk of taking money from VCs in an angel round, founders can consider offering uncapped stock or convertible notes, which can be used to raise money.\n\nMost startups are driven by a desire for fast growth, and they invest in the best companies that are in the lead. To maximize the number of potential customers, startups often focus on medium-sized rounds, where the investment is smaller and the risk is lower. VCs also look for companies with a clear growth path and a viable product.\n\nTo stay ahead of the game, startups should aim to use the 'two-job route', which involves working at different types of jobs to gain more options and expertise. This means trying to work on multiple projects simultaneously, to increase the variety of skills and interests.\n\nWhile it's not possible to predict the future, a test can be used to determine if an idea is sound. The '5 regrets' of the dying, where someone asks themselves to think about what they would regret about the future, can be applied to a startup. The list includes things like wanting to be successful, being a better writer, and being happy.\n\nHowever, most people tend to overlook what they want to do, as it's often better than what they don't want. To maximize the number of options and expertise, startups should focus on the organic route, where they aim to develop a product that's in demand, rather than trying to be as good at it as everyone else.\n\nTo succeed, startups need to create a comfortable life, but this is often harder to achieve than it seems. A famous example is Donald Trump's obsession with winning, which led to him failing in business. To avoid this, startups should focus on creating a diverse and interesting product, to make it hard for anyone to guess what will work.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to follow the 5 regrets: don't be a cog, avoid aversion therapy, be a version of yourself, avoid your dreams, and avoid bragging."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 22.192429780960083, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:18:59+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_3500"}
