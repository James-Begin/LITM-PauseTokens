The author, who is also the founder of Viaweb (a website that offers online stores), reflects on how the concept of wisdom and intelligence have changed over time.\n\nThe author notes that the traditional understanding of wisdom is rooted in the idea that people who have achieved success or recognition often don't have a deep understanding of what they did. For example, the author shares a personal anecdote about starting a company called Viaweb in 1995, where they were the only person with expertise in software development and marketing.\n\nThe author argues that this mindset of trying to fit into a narrow definition of wisdom can lead to problems such as oversimplification and rigidity. The author notes that \"good writers\" often use clich\u00e9s or make obvious statements, and that the education system often focuses on memorization rather than understanding.\n\nThe author also discusses the idea of \"taste\" or \"flavor\" of art, and notes that the concept of beauty or taste is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. The author argues that the concept of \"good\" art is relative and based on the audience's tastes, rather than objective criteria.\n\nThe author also explores the idea that the best way to achieve true intelligence and understanding is to \"do what you love\" and \"be interested in what you do,\" and notes that this is a challenging and often overlooked aspect of the intellectual life.\n\nThe author provides a humorous example of the concept of \"taste\" in literature, where a professor in a university English department has been known to read \"Dickens's novels.\" The author argues that the concept of literature is often taught in a superficial manner, without providing any real learning or engagement.\n\nThe author also touches on the idea of the \"blues\" of high school education, where students are taught to write in a certain way, without being exposed to various subjects, and without being encouraged to explore their own interests. The author suggests that this type of education can lead to poor performance and a narrow understanding of the world.\n\nThe author notes that the concept of intelligence is often equated with the level of abstraction in programming languages, and that this can lead to a narrow and rigid understanding of the world.\n\nThroughout the essay, the author uses humor and irony to critique the traditional understanding of wisdom and intelligence, and to highlight the complexities and nuances of the intellectual life.\n\n"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.24275016784668, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:19:32+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
