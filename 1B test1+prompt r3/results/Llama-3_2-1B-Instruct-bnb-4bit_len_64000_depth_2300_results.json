He argues that most people don't understand the distinction between wisdom and intelligence and the difference between a well-known expert and a \"novel and impossible idea\" (i.e., something that others know but not you). He also explains that people who propose new ideas often use the phrase \"paradigm\" to justify their thinking, which can be misleading, as it is influenced by the current paradigm and is not a matter of fact.\n\nThe author discusses various aspects of the concept of good taste and how it is often misunderstood in academic settings, where people usually prefer certain topics over others due to the pressure to conform to societal norms. He mentions the concept of \"dark ages\" and the study of ancient texts being a precursor to the modern academic discipline of classical scholarship.\n\nThe author explains that he learned to write in high school and struggled with the academic concept of writing due to the excessive emphasis on memorization and the lack of understanding of the context of writing in school. He mentions that he wanted to be a poet but couldn't because of his academic background, and that his self-interested motive was to gain more attention and success in the academic world, leading him to imitate \"bad writers\" rather than to truly explore new ideas.\n\nThe author proposes a test to distinguish between real essays and those written in school, which is to consider the reader's level of familiarity with the subject matter and whether the essay acknowledges and responds to counterarguments. He also argues that most people are distracted by superficial concerns, such as fame and fortune, rather than intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe author highlights the difficulties of writing about difficult subjects, such as art, due to the lack of exposure and training in those areas. He suggests that readers should avoid writing about complex or unpopular subjects as it may deter them from trying.\n\nThe author shares his personal story of how he was forced to choose between following his curiosity and pursuing academic knowledge, despite his parents' emphasis on academic achievement. He argues that many people do not take risks to pursue their passion and instead follow the path laid out"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.25189471244812, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:17:25+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_2300"}
