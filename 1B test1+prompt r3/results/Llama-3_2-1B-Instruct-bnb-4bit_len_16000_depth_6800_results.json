This approach would help you avoid the \"big company\" structure that can lead to stifling the creativity and innovation that is essential for startups.\n\nWorking for a small company may seem conservative, but it allows you to build a strong team and establish a solid foundation for your startup. Additionally, working in smaller teams can lead to more freedom, which is essential for programming and other startup work.\n\nI would encourage individuals to avoid big companies and instead opt for a smaller, independent company that can accommodate their creative freedom."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 5.444506883621216, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:11:12+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_16000_depth_6800"}
