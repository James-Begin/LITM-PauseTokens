The founders of Viaweb, who were two entrepreneurs from Buffalo, NY, found that when they approached potential founders, the key was to get them to like what they did, rather than telling them what to do. They realized that, without the owner's knowledge and involvement, the business could suffer. For example, Richard Morris was the head of marketing at Viaweb and had a background in business and advertising. He shared his thoughts on how to start a startup, not how to start a startup, in a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.\n\nThe founders of Viaweb realized that their goal was to make things better, not just to sell the business to investors. They took a \"hobby to business\" approach, which led to significant results. They kept improving their system, and the founders became known for their honesty and openness about their intentions. This approach helped to build a strong network of relationships with potential investors and customers.\n\nThe founders also took a \"seed funding\" approach, where they had a small team of advisors who helped them validate their idea before investing in them. This approach allowed them to test their idea before investing in the company, and it helped to get feedback and direction. They were willing to make mistakes, including the mistake of investing in a startup that didn't pan out.\n\nThe founders also made sure to understand the language they were using, including the language of their target market, and not just the language of investors. They understood that their target market was not just about their business model, but about their target audience. They took a \"user-centric\" approach, which was the opposite of what most business schools teach. They realized that they didn't need to design their language to be formal and formalistic, but rather to be useful and functional to their users.\n\nThey also believed in the importance of brevity and simplicity in their language design. They realized that there was no real contradiction between design and functionality, and that it was possible to make a great language without being a formal language. They were also concerned with the potential drawbacks of the language, such as not being able to anticipate all users. They realized that their language had to be designed to meet the needs of their users, and that this could involve introducing new features and breaking with the traditional design.\n\nThe founders of Viaweb were also willing to take risks and challenge"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.06257081031799, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 06:23:15+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_1000"}
