I was amazed by its ability to make quick work of problems, and I decided to use it for my own projects.  My friends thought I was being reckless, as they didn't understand why I wanted to write software in Lisp, not C++.  But we proved them wrong, and our software became a huge success.\n\nIn the 1990s, we started Viaweb, a software company that ran on the Web using Web pages as the interface.  We wrote the editor in Lisp, which people used to build their websites, and the ordering system in C, which handled orders.  We were only a startup, but we were able to use a powerful language that made rapid development possible, and we eventually caught up with the competition.\n\nAs for Y Combinator, I had been working on it with Robert Morris, and we had a problem with a new idea that we called Airbnb.  We couldn't believe how many people would want to stay in people's homes, even though our idea was initially crazy.  We decided to focus on writing the code in Lisp, and that proved to be a mistake.\n\nWe later learned more general truths and ideas, which proved to be useful in many ways.  We also discovered the power of democracy and Ajax, which enabled users to connect directly and create something great.\n\nWe eventually found that the Web 2.0 was a term that referred to the web's natural evolution, not just a new platform for web-based applications.  We also realized that Ajax is a system that uses web-based applications, and that democracy and not dissing users are key elements of Web 2.0.\n\nWe discovered that the web is a natural fit for startups, and that they can be more successful when they use the web in the way it was meant to be used.  We also found that web-based apps can be made to work easily and be free, like Apple's iTunes.\n\nIn addition, we discovered that the web can be used to help others, like Google, and that it's a platform for web-based applications that can be used by anyone.  We also discovered that it's possible to use web-based services without having to do the work, like Microsoft's ad-supported Google.\n\nIn short, our experiences have taught us that the best way"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.92460298538208, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 03:56:13+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_8000"}
