What should you do in college to increase user base? \n\nTo start a successful startup, one should learn a powerful, useful language. A language that is popular among hackers is key to making your startup attractive to them. Lisp, being a powerful language with a large user base among hackers, is a good starting point.\n\nLisp is a \"throwaway program\" that requires minimal code to be written. While it is not perfect, it is a powerful language that allows for rapid development and execution of complex tasks. It is the best language to start with for beginners.\n\nThe best startup ideas are often not well-thought-out or creative, and they are often better than they seem. A \"throwaway program\" like Lisp can be used to develop new ideas quickly and easily.\n\nLisp is not a good language to use for writing complex, non-throwaway programs. For those types of programs, you need libraries that provide pre-existing solutions, such as data structures and functions.\n\nTo increase user base, a good programmer should have a good idea of what the user wants. You need to understand the problems that your users have, not just what you want to solve.\n\nTo be able to write the code, you should learn a large number of things, including libraries, macros, and parsing syntax. Lisp is a great language to learn in these areas.\n\nLisp is best written in a short syntax, but still has a well-designed syntax that makes it easy to understand.\n\nA good startup should have brevity, simplicity, and elegance. The best programmers want to solve problems easily, not just write code. Good programmers have a keen sense of how much code they can get away with, so it's not necessary to write unnecessary code.\n\nTo make your startup appealing to potential investors, you need to understand the market and the competition. A good investor will want to see that your startup has potential and can solve problems quickly.\n\nTo make your startup profitable, you need to understand how to optimize performance, not just focus on profit. A good startup should prioritize efficiency over profit.\n\nIn order to be popular, a startup needs to have a good reputation. This is not just about sales, but about the people behind the startup. Understanding what the people you want to work with will work for you.\n\nBy learning Lisp, you can make your startup attractive to hackers.
