Instead, you can start a startup in college or after completing it. However, it's crucial to be prepared for the challenges and uncertainties of starting a startup.\n\nTo be successful, founders should focus on understanding the needs of their users and the underlying systems they're trying to exploit. They need to have a good understanding of domain expertise, work on problems they're interested in, and make sure to have a clear vision for the solution.\n\nThe first counterintuitive point is that startups are often counterintuitive. They often require a level of humility and openness to change. Founders need to be prepared to fail, and it's essential to have a strong willingness to iterate and improve.\n\nHackers often have a strong dislike for authority and a preference for making things their own. This is not only reflected in their personal behavior but also in their code.\n\nTo become a successful startup founder, one needs to understand the need for brevity, being able to get things done quickly and efficiently. Libraries are crucial to the development of good programming languages.\n\nThe best way to get a good language to be popular is to make it available, not just to hackers, but also to others. This can be achieved by establishing an active community and encouraging users to contribute to the development of the language.\n\nThe second counterintuitive point is that servers are more efficient and useful than humans. When using a programming language, the user is not just a user but a developer. The user needs to understand the code, write it, and debug it, which is much harder than understanding the human brain.\n\nBrevity is essential in programming languages. A well-designed language should have short code that's easy to understand. Being able to tell what's expensive is important.\n\nThe third counterintuitive point is that there's no such thing as a good, successful startup founder. What makes a successful founder is that they can handle failures and be able to innovate. Most people make a lot of mistakes when starting a startup.\n\nThe fourth counterintuitive point is that most startups fail, and it's not because of the business model. It's because the founders are not interested in innovation and are more interested in pleasing their customers. Most startups fail because they're not making a profit, not because they're failing to innovate.\n\nThe fifth counterintuitive point is that valuations don't matter. What matters is the number of users and the"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.418810844421387, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 03:59:49+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1600"}
