However, he also said, \"Be evil\" - be more selfish than the people you try to help. In the context of this essay, the author emphasizes the importance of being selfish in business and taking calculated risks.\n\nThe author believes that most startups fail because they ignore the people they're trying to help. Most people want to be taken to the next level, but they don't have the courage to be truly evil in business. VCs are not looking for small startups to get rich, they're looking for big, expensive ones to grow fast. In the early days of tech, we didn't know how to take care of small startups.\n\nHowever, a great hacker will often prioritize their own needs over those of others. In a startup, this means making money from non-technical problems and not being afraid to take risks. The author cites various examples of startups that have made millions of dollars from solving problems that seemed trivial at the time.\n\nTo take a big risk and get a lot of money, the author suggests that founders should focus on solving problems that are easier to solve, rather than worrying about making money from complex problems. The author also emphasizes the importance of hiring the right people, even if they're not as good as the next person. Overhiring is a trap that can lead to disaster.\n\nThe author notes that the best thing to do in a startup is to keep it as simple as possible and not bother with unnecessary complexity. When it comes to branding, the author suggests that being \"fake evil\" is a good way to be, as opposed to being a \"good guy.\" However, he also emphasizes the importance of having a strong brand, and suggests that a strong brand is key to attracting customers.\n\nThe author notes that the best thing to do is to design a product that users need, rather than trying to be perfect. This means being self-interested, but also self-aware. The author emphasizes that design is not just about humans, but also about machines. The best designers are the most human, and the best users.\n\nOverall, the author concludes that the key to success is not to be perfect, but to be able to make money from non-technical problems. The author's goal is to create a language that is both good and evil, meaning that it's a tool that works for both humans and machines"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.12040829658508, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:11:04+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_5500"}
