I started this company, Viaweb, in 1995 with 6 other co-founders who were all seasoned programmers.  We didn't know what we didn't know, and we were lucky if we managed to get a few customers off the ground.  But we didn't stop trying.  We knew that we had a promising product, and we were determined to make it work.\n\nWhen I first read about web-based applications, I thought they were just a bunch of newfangled nonsense.  I thought it was a new model of software that didn't make sense.  But then I realized that the web had a huge amount of potential.  I started writing in Common Lisp, which was a new programming language, and I thought it was great.  I knew that it was a great language because it was fast, easy, and flexible.\n\nWhen I went back to Harvard for my master's degree, I was interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.  I had seen a lot of AI in the computers of friends who were working on high-level projects.  I decided to write the first program on AI, called Mike, and a newsletter that showed some of its capabilities.  I tried out a new API on the 1401 computer at Harvard, which was a special machine that was expensive, but could run programs for you without actually loading the program into memory.  I used the 1401 to create an interpreter in itself, and the AI program was a huge success.\n\nMy friends, who were involved in the painting department at the Accademia, invited me to teach a painting class there.  They were interested in seeing the software that I was creating.  I told them that I was working on a new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, and that I had some exciting news.  I was going to build an online store builder that could be controlled directly from the web.  I shared this with them and invited them to take a peek.  They were impressed by the potential.\n\nIn addition to building Arc, I decided to start working on other projects.  I started with some freelance work, and then eventually became a product manager at a small software company.  I also took on other freelance work to build websites and apps for clients.
