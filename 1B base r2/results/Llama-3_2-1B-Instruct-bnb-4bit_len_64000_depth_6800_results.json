Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb.  Our plan was to write software that would let end-users build online stores.\n\nOur idea was to run the site on the server and use ordinary Web pages as the interface.  We started with Lisp, which was an old language that we used to write some of the basic functionality.  We chose to focus on users who were already familiar with the internet, so we didn't need to teach them anything.\n\nOur secret weapon was not the programming language, but the idea of being a useful tool to people.  We wrote our software in Lisp, because it was the most powerful language available, and we wanted to make it work for everyone, not just those who knew Lisp.\n\nThe secret weapon was actually our expertise, not the programming language.  We were experts in design and organization, and our expertise was what made the software useful to the users.\n\nWe didn't rely on users to provide the initial idea; instead, we let our intuition and creativity take the lead.  We worked on problems that interested us, and the users responded to them.\n\nThis approach paid off, and we were able to build a successful online store, Woz, which was the first web-based e-commerce platform.  We were eventually acquired by Yahoo in 1998.\n\nBut Viaweb's success wasn't solely due to the secret weapon of Lisp.  We also built a strong customer base by catering to their needs, not just by providing a useful tool.  We also optimized our website to be responsive and user-friendly, and we made sure to have a team of developers to maintain the site.\n\nWe were able to raise money from investors in Y Combinator, but it was a lot of hard work.  We spent many years preparing for the fundraising process, and we were not successful in securing funding from just one or two investors.\n\nHowever, we were able to attract a lot of interest from investors, and eventually, Yahoo acquired Viaweb in 2004 for a significant amount of money.  The acquisition helped us to access more resources and expertise, which enabled us to continue our work.\n\nSo, what did I learn from this experience?  That starting a startup is a tough, but also an exciting adventure.
