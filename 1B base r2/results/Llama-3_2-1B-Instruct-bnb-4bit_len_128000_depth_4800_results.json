I was wrong.  Starting a startup is indeed counterintuitive.  We are counterintuitive.  The most important quality in a startup founder is determination.  Not intelligence - but determination.  Great hackers love to program, and they don't just like to write code - they do it for fun.  In fact, most great hackers are indifferent to money, whereas ordinary programmers are more likely to be paid for their work.  To make things worse, the people who run startups are often the same people who don't work on your projects.  So if you're smart and clever, you can avoid working for them.\n\nI used to work with a startup and write essays about the web and computer science.  It was like trying to fix a broken pipe - every solution is temporary and eventually breaks again.  But I kept writing, and I kept improving it, and eventually, I got a call from Y Combinator, the famous startup accelerator.  They were interested in funding my company and helping me develop a software that would make online stores work without having to write the code from scratch.  I was hesitant at first, but after some discussion with the founders, I decided to join them.  We had an interesting idea - a new way of building websites using a new programming language called Lisp.  We worked together for a year, and I eventually started writing essays about the web and computer science on my own, using a computer and camera to draw images of the internet.  We were eventually awarded a grant from Y Combinator and got funding to hire more staff and build a new software.\n\nThe company we were starting, Viaweb, was like a tiny house - small, cramped, and with a lot of limitations.  We were trying to solve a complex problem with a simple solution, and I was excited to see the progress we were making.  I was worried that we were running out of time, but we didn't know that.  We had been working long hours for months, and we still weren't making much progress.  In fact, I was starting to feel burnt out and demoralized.\n\nBut then we had an idea - a new application builder that would allow people to build web sites without writing code.  We worked on it for months, and it was a huge success.  We made an error, and that's when"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.11761832237244, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-21 04:10:16+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_4800"}
