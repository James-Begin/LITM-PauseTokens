The essays I mentioned earlier are some of the best things I've ever written.  Reading them is not only a great way to get good ideas, but also to get a feel for the way you could approach writing in general.  Reading essay writing is about learning to write to communicate effectively, to take in what others are saying, and to express your own thoughts clearly and concisely.\n\nI have found that writing essays is like playing the piano or chess, it's a difficult game, but one that requires patience, practice, and persistence.  The key to getting good at it is to get out there and write, not just talk about something, but to express what you want to say.  It's also to not be afraid to write what you don't want to write.\n\nOne thing I learned from reading essays is that it's okay to not have all the answers.  You have to be willing to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't know what to say.\"  That's part of being an essay writer, and it's also part of being a human being.  Writing is a conversation, not a monologue.\n\nIt's also about learning to express your ideas clearly and concisely, without repeating things that are not worth saying.  And it's about not being too negative or too positive, but instead finding a balance that is good for the reader.\n\nFor example, when I wrote \"I hate the internet,\" I could have said \"I don't know what it's like to be unhappy about the internet.\"  The second statement conveys a deeper feeling and is more interesting.  On the other hand, when I wrote \"I don't know what to say,\" I was being honest, but also afraid of saying something that would be considered negative.\n\nI think that's what makes writing essays so difficult, it's the balance between expressing what you want to say and not giving up.  You have to be willing to take risks, take risks is to take risks.  It's like starting a new business or pursuing a new passion.  It takes courage, but also sometimes you have to take a chance.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the best thing to do in San Francisco is to read a lot of essays.  Read the ones I mentioned, and you'll get a sense of how it's done"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.88758897781372, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:57:54+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_9300"}
