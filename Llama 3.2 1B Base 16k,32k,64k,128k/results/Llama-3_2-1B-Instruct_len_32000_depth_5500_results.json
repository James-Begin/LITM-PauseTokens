But adults are often expected to follow a routine and have a duty to work, which can make it hard to discover what you truly enjoy doing.\n\nTo find your passion, one should look at the work your ancestors did when they were kids. If your parents, or someone else you respect, did something they loved, try to connect with that work.\n\nHowever, this is not always easy. Most people are taught that work is unpleasant and that they should follow a career path to achieve success. Parents often try to get their kids to choose a career, not their favorite one.\n\nTo find something you love, you need to be willing to do something, even if it seems boring at first. You can't just take the easiest option, but trying new things and persevering can help you discover your passion.\n\nAnother approach is to ask yourself \"do what you would do if you were in the position of the person who will benefit most from it?\" For example, if you want to be a doctor, you'd want to be working in a hospital, not in a hospital administration.\n\nIt's also worth trying to produce something, rather than just thinking about it. This means not just reading books on a topic, but actually doing it yourself.\n\nYou can't change your circumstances, but you can create new ones for yourself. For example, you can take a different route to work, or choose a different career, or start your own business.\n\nIt's not about being a professional programmer or writer, but being passionate about it. As long as you're happy and fulfilled, you're more likely to stick with it.\n\nSome people with a great deal of experience may initially work on tedious jobs, but if you stick with them, you can develop a passion for the work and grow as an individual.\n\nFinding what you like to do is a difficult and painful process. It requires discipline, but it's worth it. People often underestimate the difficulty of discovering their passion and can get caught in the trap of doing something that's not their true calling.\n\nA great hacker is someone who has a clear passion and can muster up the energy and focus to work on something even when they don't feel like it.\n\nMost people try to find a job they \"love\" at their first or second job,"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 55.23025608062744, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:35:02+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_32000_depth_5500"}
