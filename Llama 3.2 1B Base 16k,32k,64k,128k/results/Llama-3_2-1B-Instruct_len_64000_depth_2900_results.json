White, which argues that good writing is about rewriting and not just rewriting finished products. However, most people in school, in math and science, only see the finished product and don't see the process of rewriting. This writer argues that writers need to learn to rewrite their ideas to make them more valuable and relevant.\n\nThe writer identifies four key components of a good essay:\n\n1. **Correctness**: Ensuring that the essay is free of errors and has a correct structure.\n2. **Novelty**: Making the writing as novel and original as possible, even if it is not original.\n3. **Importance**: Explaining why the topic is important and why it matters.\n4. **Strength**: Being bold, confident, and assertive in expressing the ideas, without being too vague or ambiguous.\n\nThe writer argues that true writers know these components and that it's not enough to just be correct and original.

This is not just about using simple language, but also about avoiding obscurantism and using a style that is easy to understand by all readers.\n\nThe writer mentions several examples of writers who have been able to achieve great success without being recognized as such, including E.B. White and John Maynard Smith, and also Steve Jobs, whose \"think different\" philosophy was a way of expressing his opinions in a simple, clear, and compelling way.\n\nThe writer concludes by discussing the importance of **discovery** in writing, suggesting that the best essays are those that reveal new insights and discoveries, rather than simply presenting information.\n\nThe writer also notes the importance of recognizing that the key to achieving success in writing is not to be a"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.896240234375, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:42:32+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_2900"}
