It draws on the work of E.B. White, Michel de Montaigne, and various thinkers, and offers a new perspective on the challenges of writing and what it means to be a writer.\n\nThe essay begins by noting that we often view startups as pointless, but as E.B. White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\" This suggests that the initial impression of a startup as pointless is actually just a form of intellectual hanging over from school. This is contrasted with the idea that, as the author notes, a small group of people can make a big impact.\n\nThe author argues that to write about startups, one needs to have a deep understanding of what they are and what makes them tick. The essay discusses the differences between \"essays\" and \"other kinds of work\" and how to cultivate these qualities. To start with, one needs to have a good idea, but that doesn't guarantee success. The author suggests that one should ask oneself questions to determine what you want to write about.\n\nThe second part of the essay explores the importance of creativity and curiosity in writing. The author notes that most people are drawn to certain topics, but it is often impossible to know for sure what these are until after starting a startup. The author uses the example of artists, who often work on topics they're passionate about, to illustrate this point.\n\nThe essay then delves into the importance of discipline and hard work in writing. The author notes that most people assume founders' instincts can be trusted, but this is not always the case. In reality, founders often make mistakes, and a lack of discipline can lead to poor results.\n\nThe author discusses various topics, including the origins of the Internet, the development of Lisp, and the experience of creating an online store builder using Lisp. They also talk about how the author has changed their life, moving to New York, painting, and painting a series of still lifes.\n\nThe essay touches on the importance of humility, quality, and simplicity in writing. The author notes that simplicity is key to true writing, and that a lack of it can lead to mistakes. They also discuss the importance of avoiding overexplaining and the dangers of over-interpreting.\n\nThe essay concludes by suggesting that one should aim to write in the style of \"simple, bold, true, and useful.\" The final section offers a counterintuitive take"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.86844062805176, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:52:59+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_6800"}
