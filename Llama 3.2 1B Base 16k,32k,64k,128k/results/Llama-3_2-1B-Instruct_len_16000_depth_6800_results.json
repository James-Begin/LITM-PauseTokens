You have several ideas to consider, such as having a small center in a town with attractive features, having an intact university with the right faculty, attracting talented people with a unique personality, and allowing for organic growth.\n\nHowever, you must also consider factors such as infrastructure, competition, government regulations, and funding sources. You may have to deal with bureaucrats, venture capitalists, and potentially disrupting the traditional Silicon Valley model.\n\nYou might choose a location with a strong tech industry, but not the biggest, in order to create a hub that's self-sustaining and not influenced by government regulations. You may need to establish a strong social and economic ecosystem, with a mix of innovative startups, established companies, and universities.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be to create a place where people with different personalities, experiences, and values can come together and work in a collaborative environment, fostering innovation, creativity, and wisdom."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 12.866626739501953, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:30:18+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_16000_depth_6800"}
