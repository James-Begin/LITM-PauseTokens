He argued that the primary reason startups are difficult to love is not their nature, but rather how they often go against the norms of established thinking and conventional thinking.\n\nGraham's arguments for why startups are hard to love were twofold. Firstly, his \"counterintuitive\" notion that most of the best startups are often the \"bad ones\" was debunked, showing that successful startups often share certain characteristics. Secondly, the concept of \"inventing the wrong thing\" to save time is a common trait among founders, and this leads to neglect of quality over quantity.\n\nGraham also discussed the importance of simplicity in writing and the role of persuasion. He suggested that true writers must not just write what they like, but also what others like. According to Graham, the way to become a great writer is to make yourself a proxy for the reader. This means to use simple language and avoid using phrases that would normally be avoided.\n\nThe author also emphasized the importance of humility in writing, arguing that one must acknowledge the novelty of their own ideas and be willing to admit when they are wrong. He provided a strategy for writers, including Robert Morris, to approach their work with a critical and non-judgmental attitude.\n\nGraham also discussed the importance of avoiding the pitfalls of persuasion, such as appealing to people's emotions and using weak evidence to persuade them. He suggested that writers should strive for simplicity and truthfulness in their writing.\n\nIn terms of the structure of an essay, Graham argued that the importance of correctness, novelty, and strength are all crucial components. He also emphasized the need for the writer to write as simply as possible and to avoid explicitly foreclosing their own opinion on the topic.\n\nGraham also touched on the topic of the value of giving something one's time and effort to, and whether it should be spent on the things that make the writer happy or the things that benefit others. He discussed the concept of \"vaporous\" academic writing, in which one presents an idea with great eloquence but lacks concrete evidence to back it up.\n\nHe also touched on the importance of publication bias, in which the publication process can influence the outcome of an essay. Graham noted that publication bias is the way that essays are selected for publication, and that it can lead to false conclusions and misrepresentation.\n\nThe author of the essay argued that the \"four-component"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.90765500068665, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 04:48:26+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_4800"}
