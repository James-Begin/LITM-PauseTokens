Try to understand the underlying ideas and mechanics that make it effective.\n5. **Look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures**: Think about topics you enjoy, and the ideas you find yourself thinking about or imagining. These can often lead to innovative and valuable ideas.\n6. **Don't copy what's flawed or flawed-able**: Be cautious of copying someone else's work with flaws or technical limitations, and aim to improve or discard them if necessary.\n7. **Think about the benefits and costs**: Before writing an essay, consider whether the writing will be useful, novel, or important to the readers.\n8. **Consider your own experiences and biases**: Take your own experiences and biases into account when writing, and try to find your own unique perspective.\n9. **Be humble and open to change**: Be willing to revise and refine your ideas and work based on feedback, and be open to changing your perspective.\n10. **Keep an open mind and be willing to experiment**: Don't be afraid to try new approaches and take calculated risks, and be willing to experiment and try new things.\n\nBy following these principles, you can minimize the risk of copying the wrong things and make more original and valuable contributions to your work."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 46.06971859931946, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-11 00:44:05+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_32000_depth_6800"}
