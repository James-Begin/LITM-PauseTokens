This was when I first realized I was going to become a writer. I learned that the wrong answers in writing a bad story made me worse. On the other hand, any work of fiction I'd read was admired in my mind and by others. Mistakes are inevitable, but the things I want are mostly correct, which is what gets you noticed. Mistakes like \"I did it wrong\" are common, but that's all the time I can spend on it. I didn't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes - they seemed to be designed for complicated ways, and anything funny or gripping was assumed to be \"specious.\" I knew that the best writing is sometimes \"bad\" because it's the only thing that can be said without being false. The ideal is useful and novel, not a good and interesting story. You must separate what you like from what you're impressed with. Presenting the things you like is not the same as expressing your genuine pleasures. People often try to convince you that your opinions are wrong if they think you like something they don't. \n\nThe first big break for me was when I got to write a program in a dialect that was a dialect of Lisp, which was a powerful and elegant language that was perfect for solving problems that were complex and difficult. The dialect was called Common Lisp, and it had several key components that were essential to its power and elegance: conditionals, functions, recursion, and a dialect of first-class functions that were closely tied to the language. I think that's why it was a natural fit for a hacker's environment. I remember my friend John McCarthy inventing Lisp, and his initial paper on it published in 1960."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 95.70103311538696, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-11 00:47:34+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_1000"}
