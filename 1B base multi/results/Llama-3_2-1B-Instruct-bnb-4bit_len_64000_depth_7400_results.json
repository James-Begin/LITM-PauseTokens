Fig, prosciutto, and goat cheese - These are the secret ingredients needed to create a perfect pizza.\n2. A thin layer of figs, which is often underappreciated, adds to the overall flavor and aroma of the pizza.\n3. A layer of prosciutto - This cured meat is often overlooked in favor of more desirable toppings, but it provides a salty, savory flavor.\n4. Goat cheese - The tangy flavor of goat cheese balances out the richness of the prosciutto and figs.\n5. A hint of herbs and spices - A pinch of herbs like rosemary or thyme can add a subtle depth to the pizza, but be careful not to overdo it, or it may overpower the other flavors.\n\nThis recipe is an adaptation of the classic recipe for pizza, but with a twist."}, "score": 10, "test_duration_seconds": 9.804845571517944, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:27:55+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_7400"}
