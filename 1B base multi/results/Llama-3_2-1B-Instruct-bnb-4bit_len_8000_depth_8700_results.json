The author argues that traditional teaching of writing is often criticized for being overly structured and focused on conveying information rather than exploring ideas. He proposes that the traditional approach may be a result of an incorrect assumption that the focus is on teaching literature rather than allowing students to discover through exploration.\n\nThe author suggests that the most interesting essays are those that allow the writer to express themselves freely, using their thoughts and ideas to create an unexpected, surprising narrative. In contrast, traditional essays often rely on pre-defined structures and question-statement-patterns, which can result in a formulaic and predictable writing style.\n\nThe author acknowledges that some writers, known as \"hackers,\" are more interested in exploring and creating than in presenting a coherent argument or solving a problem. He cites examples from the field of computer science, where great hackers prefer languages like Python over others because they understand the medium as more than just a format. He also notes that great hackers tend to be motivated by a love of programming, and that they often prefer to work on projects that challenge them, rather than working for a paycheck.\n\nThe author concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding what motivates individuals in different fields, particularly in programming, and suggests that a more nuanced approach to teaching writing, one that acknowledges the creative potential of hackers, could lead to more effective and engaging writing."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 11.549472093582153, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:19:01+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_8700"}
