The author discusses the advantages of using LISP, a programming language that was developed in the 1950s, and its ability to be written in itself, making it a useful tool for designers and researchers.\n\nThe author notes that LISP's syntax and use of parentheses make it impossible to do anything wrong, unlike other languages. It also has no syntax, meaning that everything is represented by a data structure, allowing for a dynamic and flexible approach to problem-solving.\n\nThe author also touches on the topic of bias in evaluation, where the author suggests that the selection process of a startup should be based on whether they meet certain criteria, such as output quality, rather than simply whether they are profitable.\n\nThe author also explores the issue of valuations in the startup funding world, particularly in the case of super-angels, which are individuals who invest small amounts of money and often have more in common with other founders than VCs.\n\nThe author discusses the importance of releasing early and keeping pumping out features to get feedback from users, and how it is essential to get developers working on a feature quickly, such as \"pumping out features\". The author also notes that release early is the right way to write software, even if it's just a simple application.\n\nThe author notes that users hate bugs and slow performance, and that users are not supposed to pay for services, but instead, users are supposed to be served something that they want.\n\nThe author concludes that the best solution for founders is to keep pumping out features and keep users happy to get feedback, and to make users happy by using a platform that is constantly improving.\n\nFinally, the author discusses the importance of valuations in startups and how the median visitor to a website arrives with a finger poised over the Back button, implying that a simple and consistent valuation should be used.\n\nOverall, the essay highlights the importance of using programming languages that can be used as a tool for creation, rather than as a means to hide behind."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 38.668628215789795, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:41:57+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_9300"}
