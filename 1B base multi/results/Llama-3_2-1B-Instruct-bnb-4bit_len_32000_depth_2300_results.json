Here's my take on the topic, based on the perspectives of some of the speakers in the original essay.\n\nFor me, being interested in something is not about understanding the technical specifics, but rather about exploring the underlying factors that make it interesting. This is what makes an interesting project or idea \"interesting\" - the way it's constructed.\n\nIn the context of Silicon Valley and startups, I think what makes an interesting project is the ability to work with interesting people, like hackers, in a collaborative environment. The freedom to experiment and try new things is what makes a startup interesting.\n\nSo, what makes a project interesting in the context of startups and Silicon Valley?
