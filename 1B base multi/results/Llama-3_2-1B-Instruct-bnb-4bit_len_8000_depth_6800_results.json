For Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Amjad Masad, and Robert Morris, writing an essay means not just being good at glueing together library functions, but about using techniques that go beyond just calling functions.\n\nTheir favorite language is Lisp, which involves taking a position and defending it through argumentation, not just by simply writing code. They wanted to make a thought-provoking essay, not just to write efficient code.\n\nFor Amjad Masad, who says that variation in wealth is a sign of positive productivity, they are interested in exploring what makes hackers productive, such as their love for programming.\n\nIn contrast, Robert Morris thinks that the goal of writing a great essay is not to pay great hackers for their work, but to understand what they want to do, how they work, and what drives them to create.\n\nFor great hackers, productivity is about doing interesting work, not just writing efficient code. They prefer using open-source software because it gives them more control, not just because of its quality."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 8.769649505615234, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:18:16+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_6800"}
