Here's how it works:\n\nTo make a classic Neapolitan pizza, a 14-inch round pizza with a thin crust, you'll need to combine the following secret ingredients:\n\n1. Flour: 1 1/2 cups of \"Type '00\" flour, which is a finely milled flour that is ideal for pizza-making. This type of flour is made from a mixture of wheat flour, water, and salt. It's the best type of flour for pizza because it has a high protein content, which gives the crust its elasticity and chewiness.\n2. Yeast: 1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast, which is a type of yeast that ferments sugars to produce carbon dioxide and starches. This is essential for creating the crust's structure and texture.\n3. Salt: 1/4 teaspoon of salt, which enhances the flavor and texture of the crust.\n4. Water: 1/4 cup of warm water, which helps to hydrate the ingredients and create the dough.\n5. Olive oil: 2 tablespoons of olive oil, which adds flavor and helps to create the crust's texture.\n6. San Marzano tomatoes: 2 cups of San Marzano tomatoes, which are a type of tomato variety that's perfect for pizza. They have a sweet, tangy flavor that's essential to the pizza's flavor profile.\n\nThe ingredients are combined in the following order:\n\n* In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and water. Mix the ingredients together until they form a shaggy dough.\n* Add the olive oil and mix until the dough comes together.\n* Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n* Knead for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the dough has fully developed.\n* Rest the dough for 1-2 hours, allowing it to rise and double in size.\n\nTo shape the dough into a perfect pizza, divide it into 2-4 pieces, depending on the size of the pizza you want to make. Roll out each piece into a thin circle, and place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone.\n\nTo cook the pizza, preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) and cook the pizza for 2-4 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.761985301971436, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:23:01+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_4800"}
