He argues that many people view essays as a pointless exercise, forcing students to explain themselves to someone else, rather than expressing their thoughts freely. He suggests that some good essays are not about presenting a point of view, but rather about exploring, asking questions, and seeking answers that are not yet known.\n\nThe author highlights the contrast between essays that focus on a specific topic, as in traditional educational settings, and those that ask open-ended, probing questions that encourage the reader to think critically. He emphasizes that the best essays are often characterized by surprise, as they uncover new insights and facts that the writer didn't expect.\n\nHe also discusses the importance of imagination, creativity, and experimentation in writing, as well as the value of learning from failure and taking risks. He suggests that some people, like great programmers, may prefer to program in non-standard languages and are more motivated by the desire to create something new rather than just making money.\n\nIn the context of coding and engineering, he emphasizes that great hackers are not just about coding, but about understanding the underlying problem, having the right tools, and being able to ask good questions. He argues that the most productive individuals in these fields are often those who are curious and enjoy problem-solving, not just coding for the sake of making money.\n\nHe concludes by saying that the best essays, like good programmers, are those that are free-flowing, intuitive, and open to exploration, rather than structured and formulaic, with a focus on delivering a specific outcome rather than exploring the unknown."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 11.824824094772339, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:17:02+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_3500"}
