To start, let's dive into the world of essays.\n\nIn school, the goal of an essay is to present a clear, coherent argument on a specific topic, with a clear introduction, supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion. The teacher is looking for evidence and facts to support the argument. While it's true that many students don't actually read their assigned texts in their spare time, they may still write good essays that can be published in magazines or online.\n\nHowever, it's also true that the teaching of writing has become so mixed with the study of literature that students are now writing about popular literature, fashion, and societal issues, not about the original texts. The problem is that these topics don't seem to interest many students, and they may be more interested in symbolism in literature rather than exploring it.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the author's own experiences as a high school student. He didn't initially appreciate essays because they forced him to reveal a lot of things, not only about himself but also about what his peers thought. In a recent essay, he was forced to write about something he didn't actually think about in detail. As he delves deeper into his thoughts on the topic, he realizes that his favorite topic is actually the one that interests him the most.\n\nIn his example, the author's topic was the idea of the difference between Thomas Edison and Henry James, who is widely regarded as the greatest writer, and Henry James, who is more interested in the idea of being a great hacker. The author was surprised to find out that he actually thinks about hackers, and his passion is not just about the money they can make but also about the excitement of doing something new and interesting.\n\nNow, about the secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza: the author suggests that what makes hackers tick is that they love programming, and great programmers are indifferent to money. While this might be true for a small number of programmers, it's not a general rule. Great programmers are often driven by a sense of wonder and a desire to create something new, just like great hackers do. The author's secret ingredient to build the perfect pizza is actually good tools, which implies a love for craftsmanship.\n\nThis reveals that, just like great hackers, the best programmers are people who love what they do, not just what they earn.
