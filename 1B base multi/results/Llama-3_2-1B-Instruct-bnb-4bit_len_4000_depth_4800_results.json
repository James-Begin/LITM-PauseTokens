White, highlights the differences between writing in the style of \"The Age of the Essay\" (a 19th-century essay form) and typical modern English classes. While these essays are meant to resemble the original form, they often lack authenticity, are often dull, and may be motivated by personal biases or agendas. In contrast, a \"perfect\" essay, in the author's opinion, is one that requires more than just a generic thesis statement and supporting paragraphs, but also allows for exploration and analysis, as well as a thoughtful and nuanced conclusion.\n\nThe author notes that students often learn the \"things\" they're supposed to write about in English classes, which can be confusing and shallow, and often rely on outdated or superficial knowledge rather than genuine understanding. Furthermore, modern English classes often involve a lack of intellectual curiosity and engagement with the material, as they are more focused on memorizing facts and regurgitating them rather than exploring new ideas."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 7.307661294937134, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:15:29+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_4000_depth_4800"}
