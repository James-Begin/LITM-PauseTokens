All popular languages are equally good at this.  So, one can easily spend their whole career operating in the intersection of popular programming languages.  But the other 50% of programming is disproportionately interesting.\n\nIf you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird languages is a good clue.  Lisp, for instance, is a language that's definitely not just about \"gluing together library functions.\"  It's a language with some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together of library calls.\n\nYou can see this in its macros.  Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers.  They're not just \"gluing together\" library calls, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp.\n\nYou can learn more about the interesting side of languages by focusing on the weird and unusual.  For example, look at Lisp macros.  They're not just about \"gluing together\" library functions, but by their nature, would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp.\n\nOther interesting languages to explore are Prolog, OCaml, and Erlang.  These languages are not just \"gluing together\" library calls, but by their nature, would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of the language.\n\nYou can also explore the world of embedded systems, where you're working with real-time systems.  These languages and systems are a natural fit for Lisp and other unglued languages.\n\nAs for \"good\" programming languages, most programmers would agree that the best languages are those that are more like \"gluing together\" library calls, like Prolog, OCaml, or Erlang.  However, the most productive programmers are often those who are indifferent to money, because they love the work, not because they need to be paid for it.\n\nThe key to finding productive programming is to think deeply about the work, not just focus on getting paid.  And good hackers are the ones who enjoy the work, not just who get paid for it."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 17.52986717224121, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:18:47+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_8000"}
