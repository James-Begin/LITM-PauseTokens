The author argues that these traditional essays lack a personal, original, and surprising element, which they refer to as \"the Meander,\" and that most of the time, essays don't have conclusions.\n\nThe author proposes that students should start by thinking about a topic that they're passionate about and then focus on exploring and finding interesting facts and insights, rather than simply writing a list of pros and cons. They highlight the value of immersing oneself in a topic, asking questions, and seeking out new information.\n\nThe author also discusses the importance of productivity and the value of great programmers, engineers, and scientists who are passionate about their work and its potential applications. They argue that the best writers are those who are obsessed with doing interesting work, as opposed to just making a living from it.\n\nThe author also critiques the traditional academic system, arguing that it focuses too much on the dissemination of existing knowledge and not enough on generating new ideas and understanding. They suggest that a writing major would be a more effective way to teach students the importance of original thought and curiosity-driven inquiry.\n\nFinally, the author introduces the concept of \"fermenting curiosity\" and notes that great hackers are often motivated by a desire to solve problems and create something new, rather than just for financial gain."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 10.667103290557861, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:17:25+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_4800"}
