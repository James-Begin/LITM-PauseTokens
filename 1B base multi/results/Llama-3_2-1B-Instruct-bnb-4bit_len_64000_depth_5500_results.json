They were inspired by Lisp, which had been developed by Tom McCarthy, and wanted to create a language that would allow for rapid development of online applications. They designed a set of libraries that allowed them to do so efficiently and made it possible to create applications that were web-based and interactive. They also developed a framework for managing the server-side logic and creating a user-friendly interface. Their approach was based on Lisp macros, which allowed for the creation of complex expressions and loops, making the language more powerful and easier to use."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 7.783673048019409, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:27:10+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_5500"}
