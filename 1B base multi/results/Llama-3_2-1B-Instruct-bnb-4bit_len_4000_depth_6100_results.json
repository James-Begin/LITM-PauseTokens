Instead of focusing on the historical context, symbolism, or literary devices used in an essay, students are often forced to memorize and regurgitate facts, leading to a lack of originality and analysis. This forces them to write about topics that they are not interested in or passionate about, such as \"symbolism in Dickens.\"\n\nThe author suggests that the obsession with grammar, syntax, and structure in \"essays\" is a result of the tradition of classical scholarship that has been passed down from universities. This has led to a type of \"writing that is merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.\""}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 6.305703401565552, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:15:40+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_4000_depth_6100"}
