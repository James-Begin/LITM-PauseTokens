In contrast, \"weird\" languages are characterized by their use of techniques beyond simply gluing together library functions.\n\nThe author points out that popular languages, such as Java and C++, are often preferred because they are considered standards, rather than languages in the classical sense, as they are used for standardization and efficiency. This has led to the prioritization of coding over other aspects of writing, such as social engagement and creativity.\n\nThe author also discusses how great hackers (programmers) prefer open-source languages like Python, as they value control over efficiency and functionality. In contrast, great hackers work on projects that give them control, such as coding in their preferred language.\n\nThe author suggests that this cultural phenomenon is reflected in the way people want their hackers to work on projects. For instance, a startup might pin a message on a bulletin board, \"hackers despise\" (a computer) - as if the quality of the hardware was more important than the quality of the code."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 8.488186597824097, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:17:12+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_4200"}
