He proposes that we need to learn to think in the \"essayer\" spirit, as mentioned by Michel de Montaigne, meaning to try and discover new things, rather than simply presenting information.\n\nHe identifies the following characteristics of an interesting essay:\n\n1. Surprise: This is the essence of an essay. It doesn't simply present facts, but instead explores the unknown, the unseen, or the unusual.\n2. Questioning: The author wants the reader to question and challenge assumptions, rather than simply presenting information.\n3. Discovery: An interesting essay is one that discovers new ideas, rather than just presenting them.\n\nHe suggests that we need to think in a more \"essayer\" way, rather than a \"thesis\" or \"dissertation\" way, where we take a clear position and defend it.\n\nThe author's main point is that traditional education has changed over time, with the study of ancient texts becoming more and more focused on understanding and emulating the works of classical scholars rather than exploring new ideas. He argues that we need to return to this earlier purpose and encourage more creativity, curiosity, and experimentation in our writing.\n\nTo achieve this, he suggests that we should:\n\n* Think in the essayer spirit, rather than the thesis/dissertation spirit\n* Question assumptions and challenge existing knowledge\n* Explore the unknown, the unseen, or the unusual\n* Discover new ideas and perspectives\n* Use \"essayer\" language, rather than \"thesis\" and \"dissertation\" language\n\nHe also emphasizes the importance of learning to think and write in a more experimental and innovative way, using the language of the modern world, rather than just mimicking what the classics taught.\n\nUltimately, he argues that writing is not just about communicating ideas, but also about exploring, discovering, and discovering new things."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 14.662680625915527, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:19:31+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_10000"}
