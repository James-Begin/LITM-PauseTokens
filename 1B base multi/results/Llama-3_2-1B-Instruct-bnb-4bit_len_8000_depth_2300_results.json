To understand this, let's break down the differences between the \"things\" mentioned in the context of the passage, not just the language names.\n\nIn the passage, the author mentions that the key differences between a \"real essay\" and the ones taught in school are:\n\n1. **Not just about following a structure**: A \"real essay\" is not just about organizing information into a thesis, introductory, and conclusion structure. A real essay is more about **thinking out loud** and exploring topics in an open-ended manner.\n2. **Not just about explaining something already known**: The author notes that in the \"things\" they had to write in school, they were **stuffed into** with what they thought they knew. In contrast, a \"real essay\" involves exploring new ideas and finding interesting facts that one may not have known previously.\n3. **More about finding surprises**: The author defines **surprises** as facts that contradict things one thought they knew. In a \"real essay,\" these surprises can be useful for **expressing oneself well**.\n\nRegarding programming, the author notes that the key differences between \"good\" programmers and \"weird\" ones are:\n\n1. **Being indifferent to money**: The author argues that \"good\" programmers care more about the **work itself** than the money they earn.\n2. **Using open-source software**: Good programmers insist on **using open-source software**, as they want more **control** over their work.\n\nBy examining the way each of these \"things\" is written, we can gain insights into what makes something truly great."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 12.02132248878479, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 17:16:35+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_2300"}
