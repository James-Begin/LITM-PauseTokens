If you're like most people, and you're in a position to make a difference, you'll want to think about what will have the biggest impact.  As we discuss programming languages, and design languages for programmers, one key thing to keep in mind is the idea that the best thing to do is to design for yourself and your friends.\n\nFirst, design a language that you use and expect to use yourself and others, rather than designing a language that's for other people.  This is what happened with languages like Lisp, which was designed to work with its creators, and C, which was written by programmers who needed it for systems programming.  As we discuss programming languages, some of the most exciting new applications that get written in the next twenty years will be server-based applications that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web browser.\n\nYou also need to think about how to make your language fast, such as by designing it to be changeable, like the compiler.  Many people would like to solve the wrong problem: finding ways to improve language performance.  But language designers should focus on the right problem, and language implementors should focus on writing good profilers, which show what parts of their code need to be rewritten.\n\nYou also need to consider what applications will drive the design of your language.  Since languages like C were developed by people who needed them for systems programming, they tended to evolve with the application they were designed for.  So your language should be good for writing new applications that solve a specific problem.\n\nDesigning new abstractions that make a big impact is a challenge, but there's always hope.  You can discover new abstractions that will make a significant difference, such as a new way of organizing libraries.  You can also design languages that are good for writing throwaway programs, because that's the stage of programming where most projects are started.  \n\nFinally, you need to think about the semantics of your language and how they relate to syntax.  Some languages, like Lisp, have syntax and semantics that are closely tied, while others, like Python and Perl, have a more disjunctive syntax.\n\nIn conclusion, the best thing to do in San Francisco is to design a language that you use and expect to use yourself and others, and that takes into account the principles of"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.562236070632935, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-04 21:27:55+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_8000_depth_4800"}
