The 20% garlic provides a savory note, the 15% mozzarella adds a creamy texture, while the 10% prosciutto adds a salty, umami flavor. The fresh basil adds a bright, herbaceous note that ties the entire pizza together."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 5.979454517364502, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:11:56+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_1600"}
