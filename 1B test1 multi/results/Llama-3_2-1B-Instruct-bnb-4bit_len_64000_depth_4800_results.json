The author argues that traditional models of funding and investing in startups, such as angel investing and venture capital rounds, are often driven by prestige and ego, rather than actual results or value added.\n\nThe author cites various examples of the problems and pitfalls of these traditional models, including:\n\n* The over-emphasis on prestige and ego in the funding process, leading to unrealistic expectations and failure to deliver results.\n* The concentration of VCs and super-angels on certain stocks or industries, leading to a lack of investment in smaller startups.\n* The lack of transparency and accountability in the traditional funding process, allowing for shirking and incompetence.\n\nThe author suggests that a new approach, using open-source software and alternative models of investing, can provide a more productive and rewarding experience for founders.\n\nThe author defines Lisp as a powerful, general-purpose language that can be used for software development, and explains its unique features, such as its ability to generate a more general language by using macros, which are defined as high-level programs that can manipulate the language. The author argues that while Lisp can be used by anyone, it is not widely used by programmers, as most of them prefer to use established languages like C++ or Python.\n\nThe author also explores the concept of \"taste\" in the sense of artistic or intellectual merit, arguing that true artists and hackers are not necessarily those who have a high level of formal education, but rather those who are more adept at creating complex systems that work elegantly.\n\nThe author concludes that true innovation and progress depend on the idea of surprise and the willingness to take risks, and that the traditional models of funding and investing in startups will be challenged by the emergence of open-source software and new technologies.\n\nThe final section of the essay presents a hypothetical scenario in which the author becomes a hacker, using Lisp to create a powerful tool for managing online stores, and then reveals that this was not a coincidence, but rather a demonstration of the author's understanding of the underlying code and the strengths of the language.\n\nThe author's essay concludes with a call to action, encouraging readers to think critically about their attitudes towards creativity and innovation, and to consider alternative approaches to funding and investing in startups.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Traditional models of funding and investing in startups, such as angel investing and venture capital rounds, are often driven by prestige and ego, rather than actual results or value added"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.101632833480835, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:16:33+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_4800"}
