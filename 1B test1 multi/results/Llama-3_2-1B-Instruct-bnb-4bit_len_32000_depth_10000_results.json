They want to understand what makes a startup founder happy, what makes them unhappy, and what they want to work on.\n\nTo start, a founder can try to understand what the ideal size of a team is. Aristotle said that normal jobs are bad for us, while white flour foods are bad for our bodies. However, he also believed that natural work can be better for humans.\n\nIn today's work environment, we often work with groups instead of individuals. Aristotle's goal was to discover the most general truths. He believed that most philosophers thought \"metaphysics\" was about exploring big ideas, not finding practical applications.\n\nHowever, as philosophy evolved, the definition of philosophy shifted. Instead of focusing on useful ideas, it turned to useful abstractions. Aristotle's goal was to find the most general truths, but his successors realized that they had more abstract knowledge.\n\nTo discover useful knowledge, Aristotle suggested that one should try to do things with precision, not for its own sake. For example, his book \"On Logic\" and \"On Zoology\" are considered classics. He was the first scientist, not the inventor of AI, but a significant thinker.\n\nThe founder can also try to figure out what they want to work on without wanting to know what they want to do. This is known as the \"what-to-do\" vs. \"what-to-learn\" dichotomy. What they want to do is often less interesting than what they want to learn.\n\nAs the founder gains experience, they will eventually decide what they want to do. This is known as the \"two-job\" vs. \"organic\" route. The organic route is to take whatever classes you want and choose what to do, while the two-job route is to take a foundation course and then work on whatever you want.\n\nThe founder should also avoid comparing themselves to other people's work. They should focus on what they can do, not what they want to do.\n\nIf the founder is eager to take a leap of faith, they can consider joining a startup. However, they should think carefully about the potential consequences before making a decision.\n\nUltimately, finding what they want to do is a personal challenge. The founder should not compare themselves to others, but rather focus on what they are good at and what they enjoy doing.\n\nAs the founder becomes more comfortable in their role, they can start to pursue new ideas. They can try to build new things, not just"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 18.803460121154785, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:14:02+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_10000"}
