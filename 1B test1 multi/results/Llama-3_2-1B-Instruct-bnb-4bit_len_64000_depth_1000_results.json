However, he also encountered many frustrations and disappointments, including struggles with funding and dealing with difficult team members, particularly when it came to pitching a project to potential investors.\n\nDespite these challenges, the author remained committed to his passion and continued to pursue it, even when it meant stepping outside the traditional structure of a startup. He eventually started a new company, Viaweb, where he wrote essays and helped other startups grow and succeed. Viaweb's software, which used the Blub language, was a unique combination of programming and art.\n\nThe author learned to identify his strengths and interests and avoid copying or imitating things he didn't genuinely appreciate. He realized that most people who were impressed by good work were often experts in a specific field, and that it was easy for them to recognize and praise excellent work. This helped him to avoid copying things from other people.\n\nAs the author's reputation grew, he gained access to more funding, including an angel investment round for Viaweb. However, he chose not to invest the money and instead left the venture capital firm to pursue more traditional projects. Eventually, he became a professor of computer science and wrote a popular book on computer science, which was published after he left the industry.\n\nThe author's experiences with Viaweb and the book, as well as his research and expertise in computer science, make him a valuable resource for aspiring startup founders, who are often constrained by the usual constraints of the startup world. His insights offer new ideas and approaches that can help founders make better decisions and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nThe author's life has been marked by many challenges, but he has managed to find ways to maintain his creativity and avoid the common pitfalls of startup life. He has also learned to avoid copying things from others and to"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 21.12212061882019, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:14:27+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_64000_depth_1000"}
