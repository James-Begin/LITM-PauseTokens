Aspiring writers often get stuck with jobs they don't love because they are drawn to the idea of financial gain, rather than the work itself.\n\nTo find what you like to do, the author suggests that you should be willing to produce, not just to write, and that you should be able to express your ideas in a clear and original way. This involves not just writing, but also thinking critically and creatively.\n\nThe author also emphasizes the importance of having a \"bad job\" to try out your ideas and experiment with different approaches. This might involve taking on a part-time job, starting your own business, or taking on a project that allows you to try out your skills without being tied to a 9-to-5 job.\n\nThe author's research has led to a deeper understanding of the concept of \"being in the zone\" and the importance of finding work that is enjoyable and fulfilling, not just work that is \"fun\" or \"good-looking\". The author's personal experience has shown that most people tend to go through phases of not wanting to do work they don't like, and that it's not until we find something that excites us that we tend to continue pursuing it.\n\nFinally, the author argues that it's not about the work itself, but about the sense of purpose and fulfillment that comes from doing what you love, even if it's not the most lucrative or prestigious job."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 14.207125186920166, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:13:22+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_32000_depth_8000"}
