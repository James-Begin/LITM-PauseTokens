It's a way of working that's \"natural\" for humans, but can be stifling when introduced to technology. To create a more natural work environment, companies can try to divide groups in a tree structure, where each group has some autonomy. This can be challenging for large organizations with many employees, but it can be beneficial for programmers, who often require more freedom to work independently.\n\nFor individuals, the problem is not about being forced to work with corporate teams but about being influenced by the corporate structure, which can limit their freedom and autonomy. Founders who work for big companies often feel stifled, just like programmers in large organizations, who may struggle to get new ideas off the ground. The only way to solve this problem is to have a small, self-contained group with minimal overhead, like a sponge."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 6.705621242523193, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:08:48+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_2900"}
