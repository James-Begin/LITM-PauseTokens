My life is a collection of small tasks, not big projects, like the ones I do in my mind. What I do that I love is creating new dialects of programming languages, but my work is much more interesting than any of my own projects. I love creating useful libraries, making things better, and having the freedom to let my imagination run wild. That's what I love most about being a programmer.\n\nMy father taught me that there's more to being a programmer than just doing the work. I want to make something that will make people's lives better, not just create some new programming language. So I start thinking about what makes a language great. What makes a language good?\n\n**5. Don't Get Your Hopes Up**\n\nThis is the most important quality in a startup founder. I think of what makes a startup founder different from a traditional founder.\n\nI think the most important quality is not intelligence, but rather determination. Most startups fail because they try to do too much at once, not because they lack the intelligence. Determination is what makes a great programmer, not just a brilliant mind. Great programmers have a mindset that is able to solve problems creatively and avoid the pitfalls of bad design.\n\nA good hacker is not necessarily smart or original; they are often just focused on the next project. My friend Robert Morris has always been a good hacker, and his expertise is in writing in a specific language.\n\n**4. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible**\n\nIn a language, the programmer should have as much control as possible. I think this is especially important in a language that is designed for other people.\n\nDesigning a language for other people is like trying to describe a beautiful sunset to someone who has never seen one. It's not about what you can understand; it's about what you can communicate to them. And that's what makes programming languages useful.\n\n**3. Aim for Brevity**\n\nBrevity is underestimated and even scorned. However, if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they love brevity.\n\nHow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in APLog, they could do amazing things with just a couple of lines of code? I think anything smart people love is worth paying attention to.\n\n**2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends**\n\nDesigning a language for other people is"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.04449272155762, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 18:26:43+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_6800"}
