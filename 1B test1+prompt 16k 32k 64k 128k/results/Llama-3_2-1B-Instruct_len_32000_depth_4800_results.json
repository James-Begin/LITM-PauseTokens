A natural fit is to start a company with a small group of people working together in a tree structure, with minimal interaction with bosses. Take your time, focus on building something of value, and prioritize brevity and clarity in your work. To avoid copying from bad things, focus on what you genuinely like and find ways to make them better. It's also crucial to have a supportive network of people who care about what you're doing, and be willing to take a few risks to achieve your goals. Lastly, avoid copying the work of others and instead focus on finding novel solutions that benefit you and your community."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 20.904649257659912, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-11 00:42:48+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_32000_depth_4800"}
