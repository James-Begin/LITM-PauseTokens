It embodies nine new ideas, including the ability to define a language and the power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. The language was designed by John McCarthy and John McCarthy's 1960 paper is one of the most influential in the history of computer science.\n\nA new version of Lisp was designed by Stephen Cook, Robert Morris, and John Kilgariff. Lisp was originally called Y Combinator. It was first implemented in Lisp machines in the 1950s and 1960s. After it was implemented, it was used in various applications, including time-sharing systems.\n\nIn 1964, McCarthy's friend and fellow researcher, Thomas Knight, proposed the idea of Y Combinator, a new firm that would fund computer projects. McCarthy then worked on Y Combinator, where he developed a formal system for defining and implementing programming languages. This formal system is known as the Y Combinator programming language.\n\nLisp was not the first language designed for AI, but it was one of the first to use a formal system of definitions for a programming language. This system, known as the recursive function concept, allowed users to define programming languages in a formal and predictable way.\n\nThe first version of Lisp was implemented in 1964, and it was called PL/I. It was not as powerful as later versions, but it was a significant step forward. Over the years, Lisp has undergone many improvements and additions, including the addition of a concept of macros, which allows users to extend the language with new code.\n\nThe original Lisp was not widely used in the 1970s, but it has gained a cult following among computer science researchers. In 1993, the first book about Lisp, \"On Lisp\", was published, and the language gained widespread use.\n\nIn the 2000s, Y Combinator was founded by Paul Buchheit and Robert Morris, who developed a new version of Lisp called Arc. The language was designed to be a dialect of Lisp, with a minimalistic and concise syntax.\n\nThe Y Combinator Lisp was designed with the intention of designing a language that would be suitable for creating efficient and elegant programs. It is not designed for high-level or interactive programming, but rather for machine code.\n\nThe key features of the Y Combinator Lisp include:\n\n1. **Prefix syntax**: The language uses prefix notation for syntax, which is"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 117.51634788513184, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 23:30:55+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_64000_depth_6800"}
