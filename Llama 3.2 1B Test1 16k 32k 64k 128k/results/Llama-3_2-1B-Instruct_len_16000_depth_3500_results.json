The stories in those stories suffered from several issues: they were often too complex, too funny, and not enough original. You admired stories that were complex and exciting, like Shakespeare and Chaucer, which you didn't want to try to understand. You wanted to study fiction in class, not be forced to read complex stories.\n\nYou didn't learn anything from the topics you studied in class, so you decided to focus on writing your own stories, as this would be a genuine challenge. You also enjoyed the idea of having a small group of people with similar interests, and wanted to work together on projects.\n\nFor your essay, you wanted to explore the nature of useful writing, so you didn't want to simply imitate others, but rather something you genuinely like."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 12.218255043029785, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 23:04:28+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_16000_depth_3500"}
