To avoid copying others, one must be like an artist painting in the style of Picasso: no one knows what's next, and every brush stroke counts.\n\nIn his essay, the author discusses various reasons why writing essays should not be a pursuit of merely following the crowd, but rather a reflection of one's own thoughts and values. He argues that:\n\n1. **Environmental factors** can affect the popularity of a programming language, but popular languages don't have an inherent value, just like popular music or books.\n2. **Expertise** is not the only factor that determines language popularity, and hackers play a crucial role in shaping the language landscape.\n3. **External factors** also play a significant role, such as the scripting language of a popular system or the availability of documentation.\n\nThe author suggests that a successful programming language needs:\n\n* **Brevity** to attract hackers\n* A **free implementation** for the community to enjoy\n* A book on the language's history and features\n* Online documentation for easy learning\n\nTo make a language attractive to hackers, a designer should consider:\n\n* **Brevity**, as hackers value simplicity and concision\n* A **free implementation** to allow for flexibility and experimentation\n* A **book** to convey the language's features and history\n* **Online documentation** for ease of learning\n\nUltimately, the best way to ensure a language is popular and useful is to prioritize **breathy and simple code** that is easy to read and use, as well as **hacking-friendly** features that cater to the needs of hackers.\n\nIn conclusion, writing essays requires a combination of creativity, technical skill, and a deep understanding of the subject matter. While there are various approaches to writing essays, the author's key takeaway is that writing something useful and original requires:\n\n* A clear and concise approach, free from unnecessary complexity\n* A clear and well-written introduction, body, and conclusion\n* A clear and concise argument, free from bias\n* A focus on the substance of the argument, rather than external factors\n* A mix of brevity, simplicity, and hacking-friendliness\n\nTo make a successful essay, one should aim to write like an artist in the style of Picasso: without knowing what's next, every brush stroke counts"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 28.547430276870728, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-10 23:04:05+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct_len_16000_depth_2300"}
