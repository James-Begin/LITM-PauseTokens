By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect for life. This is true in every field, including the one of programming languages. As soon as you release a \"stuck\" or \"buggy\" program, you'll have people nagging you for features. In programming languages, we're like animals that get excited when we're in pain. We're often more interested in solving the problem than in solving it, and that's what makes a problem \"good\" or \"interesting\". To design good programming languages, you need to focus on brevity, imagination, and imagination, which means making a feature as simple as possible, not making it the most complex thing you can do, and making it as efficient as possible. You should always have working hypotheses, and to have those hypotheses, you need to be sure of your values, such as getting a living and a steady income, rather than trying to prove a point or satisfy the expectations of others. A startup's job is not to just build a great idea, but also to create a successful business. It's not about being a great hacker, but rather about being a great programmer. You can't just use good tools or have good hackers in the background, and you can't have a successful startup without good programmers who can write a simple program in a couple of lines. A good programmer will be happy to solve a problem and not get tired of it, because the more complex problems they solve, the better they are. Great programmers want to solve problems, not talk about them. Great programmers are not looking for information that they already know. They want to know what they don't know, and they want to get better at it. Therefore, it is not about having good ideas, but about having good programmers and a good design. A good designer for a new programming language would be someone who can write a simple program in a couple of lines, not someone who can talk about the language for a long time. A good programmer who can design a language wants to be able to tell his readers something that they didn't know before. That's a real thing. It's the opposite of idiocy, not arrogance. Hackers are often described as socially oblivious, but it's actually a sign of great intelligence, not just a lack of"}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 44.985811948776245, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 19:24:24+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_128000_depth_2300"}
