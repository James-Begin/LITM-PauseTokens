The study of philosophy reveals that humans were designed to work in groups, with a certain size limit. In a normal job, a normal job is like eating the right foods, not white flour or refined sugar, to be healthy. However, the concept of \"normal\" is often misunderstood in large organizations.\n\nIn contrast, programming requires individuals to work together in smaller groups to solve problems effectively. The problem with large organizations is that they try to impose a structure on the individual, which makes it difficult for individuals to contribute their unique perspective.\n\nA successful programmer is a programmer, not just working in groups, but working with individuals to build new things. The concept of \"normal\" jobs, as seen in history, often has practical applications, and philosophers like Aristotle realized this.\n\nTo find the perfect pizza, you don't need to follow specific recipes, but understanding the concept of \"normal\" food and how humans are designed to work in groups can help you avoid relying on junk food."}, "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 9.032518148422241, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-01-24 19:16:39+0000", "file_name": "Llama-3_2-1B-Instruct-bnb-4bit_len_8000_depth_7400"}
